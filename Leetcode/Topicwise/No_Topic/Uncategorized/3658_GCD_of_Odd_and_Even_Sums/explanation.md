## LeetCode: GCD of Odd and Even Sums - Detailed Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sum of odd numbers and the sum of even numbers from 1 to n.  However, the provided code doesn't actually calculate the sums of odd and even numbers. Instead, it leverages a mathematical shortcut to directly compute values proportional to those sums.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution cleverly avoids explicitly calculating the sums of odd and even numbers.  It uses the mathematical fact that the sum of odd numbers from 1 to n (if n is odd) or from 1 to n-1 (if n is even) can be expressed as n²/4 (when n is even) or (n+1)²/4 (when n is odd) and the sum of even numbers from 1 to n is n(n+1)/2.  The code directly calculates these values (potentially with slight differences due to the mentioned condition of even/odd n). Because the GCD remains the same when multiplying by a constant, the code then finds the GCD of these proportional values using Euclid's algorithm. This approach is significantly more efficient than calculating the actual sums, especially for larger values of 'n'.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:** No significant data structures are used beyond simple integer variables.
* **Algorithms:**
    * **Euclid's Algorithm (Recursive):**  The `gcd(a, b)` function implements Euclid's algorithm recursively to find the greatest common divisor of two integers efficiently.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **`private int gcd(int a, int b)`:** This is a recursive function that calculates the GCD of two integers `a` and `b` using Euclid's algorithm. The base case is when `b` is 0, in which case `a` is the GCD. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b` (`a % b`).

* **`public int gcdOfOddEvenSums(int n)`:** This function calculates the GCD of values proportional to the sum of odd and even numbers.
    * `int odd = n * n;` This line sets 'odd' directly proportional to the sum of odds. A more accurate calculation would depend on whether n is even or odd, resulting in either n²/4 or (n+1)²/4.
    * `int even = n * (n + 1);` This line sets 'even' directly proportional to the sum of evens, the actual formula being n(n+1)/2.
    * `return gcd(odd, even);` This line calls the `gcd` function to compute the GCD of the two calculated values and returns the result.

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(log(min(n², n(n+1)))) which simplifies to O(log n). The dominant factor is the time complexity of Euclid's algorithm, which is logarithmic in the smaller of the two input numbers.  The initial calculations are O(1).

* **Space Complexity:** O(log n). This is due to the recursive calls in Euclid's algorithm. The maximum depth of the recursion is proportional to the logarithm of the smaller input number.


**Improvements and Corrections:**

The provided code has a minor inaccuracy in its calculation of the sums of odd and even numbers. It uses simplified expressions that are proportional but not exactly equal.  A more accurate (but slightly less efficient) version would explicitly handle even and odd cases:

```java
class Solution {
    private int gcd(int a, int b) {
        return b==0?a:gcd(b, a%b);
    }

    public int gcdOfOddEvenSums(int n) {
        long sumOdd = (n%2 == 0) ? (n/2) * (n/2) : ((n+1)/2) * ((n+1)/2);
        long sumEven = (n/2) * (n/2 + 1);
        return (int) gcd((int) sumOdd, (int) sumEven);
    }
}
```

This improved version uses `long` to prevent potential integer overflow for larger values of `n` before casting back to `int` for the GCD function.  However, the original solution's efficiency still makes it a reasonable approach for many problem instances.  The crucial idea remains leveraging the mathematical properties to avoid explicit summation.
