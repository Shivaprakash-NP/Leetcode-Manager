## Longest Balanced Substring I - Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The "Longest Balanced Substring I" problem asks us to find the length of the longest substring within a given string `s` where the frequency of each character in the substring is the same. For instance, in "aabbcc", "aabbcc" itself, "aa", "bb", and "cc" are all balanced substrings. We need to return the maximum length of such a substring.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The provided code uses a brute-force approach. The intuition is straightforward:

1.  **Iterate through all possible substrings:**  The outer loop ( `for(int i = 0; i<n; i++)`) iterates through all possible starting positions `i` of a substring.  The inner loop (`for( j = i; j<n; j++)`) iterates through all possible ending positions `j` of a substring starting at `i`. This ensures we examine every possible substring within `s`.

2.  **Check if a substring is balanced:** For each substring, we count the frequency of each character in the substring. We use a `HashMap` to store the character counts. After counting, we check if all the counts are the same. If they are, then the substring is balanced, and we update the maximum length `ans` if the current substring's length is greater. We use a `HashSet` to check if all values in the `HashMap` are the same by inserting the frequency of each character into the `HashSet` and checking to see if the size of the set is 1.

The brute-force approach is simple to understand but can be inefficient for large input strings because of the nested loops.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **HashMap:** Used to store the frequency of each character in the current substring.
*   **HashSet:** Used to efficiently check if all character frequencies are the same.
*   **Nested Loops:**  Brute-force substring generation.
*   **`Math.max()`:** Used to update the `ans` variable (longest balanced substring).

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestBalanced(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        if(n == 1) return 1; // Base case: If the string has only one character, it's balanced.
        int ans = 0; // Initialize the maximum length to 0

        for(int i = 0; i<n; i++) { // Outer loop: Iterate through all possible starting positions of the substring
            Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>(); // Create a new HashMap for each substring
            int j = 0;
            for( j = i; j<n; j++) { // Inner loop: Iterate through all possible ending positions of the substring
                map.put(s.charAt(j), map.getOrDefault(s.charAt(j), 0)+1); // Count the frequency of the current character
                Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>(map.values()); // Create a HashSet of the character frequencies
                if(set.size() == 1) ans = Math.max(ans, j-i+1); // If all frequencies are the same, update the maximum length
            }
        }

        int l = 0; // Useless variable (doesn't affect the final answer)
        return ans; // Return the maximum length
    }
}
```

*   **`int n = s.length();`**: Gets the length of the input string `s`.
*   **`if(n == 1) return 1;`**: Handles the base case where the string has only one character. A string with only one character is balanced, so its length is 1.
*   **`int ans = 0;`**: Initializes the `ans` variable, which will store the maximum length of a balanced substring found so far.
*   **`for(int i = 0; i<n; i++)`**: The outer loop iterates from the beginning of the string to the end, setting the starting index `i` of the substring.
*   **`Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();`**: Inside the outer loop, a new `HashMap` called `map` is created. This `HashMap` is used to store the counts of each character in the current substring being considered.
*   **`for( j = i; j<n; j++)`**: The inner loop iterates from the starting index `i` to the end of the string, effectively expanding the substring.
*   **`map.put(s.charAt(j), map.getOrDefault(s.charAt(j), 0)+1);`**: This line updates the character counts in the `map`. It retrieves the character at index `j` of the string `s`. If the character is already in the `map`, its count is incremented. If not, it's added to the `map` with a count of 1.
*   **`Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>(map.values());`**: A `HashSet` called `set` is created, containing all the *values* (i.e., the character counts) from the `map`. This `HashSet` is used to determine if all character counts are equal.
*   **`if(set.size() == 1) ans = Math.max(ans, j-i+1);`**: If the size of the `set` is 1, it means that all the character counts in the current substring are the same, indicating that the substring is balanced. In this case, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the length of the substring (`j-i+1`).
*   **`int l = 0;`**: This line declares an integer variable `l` and initializes it to 0. This variable is not used anywhere else in the code and has no effect on the final result. It's likely a remnant from a previous version of the code.
*   **`return ans;`**:  Finally, the function returns the `ans`, which holds the maximum length of a balanced substring found in the input string.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n^2), where n is the length of the string. The nested loops iterate through all possible substrings, resulting in quadratic time complexity.  The `map.put()` and `set` operations inside the inner loop take relatively constant time, not affecting the overall complexity.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(k), where k is the number of distinct characters in the string `s`.  The `HashMap` `map` stores character counts, and the maximum number of entries in the map is equal to the number of distinct characters in the string. In the worst case (where all characters are distinct), k can be equal to n, resulting in a space complexity of O(n). The `HashSet` would have a maximum size of 1 in the successful condition, so its space usage is negligible compared to `HashMap`.  However, the space complexity is determined by the number of different characters, so we indicate `O(k)`.
