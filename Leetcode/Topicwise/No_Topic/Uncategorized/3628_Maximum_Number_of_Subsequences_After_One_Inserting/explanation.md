## Maximum Number of Subsequences After One Inserting: Detailed Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the maximum number of subsequences "LCT" that can be formed in a given string `s` after inserting at most one character ('L', 'C', or 'T').  The subsequences don't need to be contiguous.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution employs a clever strategy that combines counting subsequences without any insertion and then considering optimal insertions.  The core idea is to calculate the number of "LCT" subsequences directly from left-to-right and then analyze potential improvements by inserting characters at different positions.

Instead of brute-forcing all possible insertion positions and characters, the algorithm pre-computes prefix and suffix information to efficiently determine the best insertion point.

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * `String`: The input string `s`.
    * `int[]`:  Arrays `preL`, `preLC`, `sufT`, `sufCT` are used to store prefix and suffix counts of 'L', 'LC', 'T', and 'CT' subsequences respectively. This allows for efficient calculation of potential improvements from insertion.
* **Algorithms:**
    * **Counting:** The initial loop counts "LCT" subsequences without any insertion.
    * **Prefix/Suffix Sum:** The `preL`, `preLC`, `sufT`, `sufCT` arrays are populated using prefix and suffix sum techniques.
    * **Iteration:** A final loop iterates through the string to find the maximum number of "LCT" subsequences achievable with one insertion.
    * **Dynamic Programming (implicit):** The prefix/suffix calculations can be viewed as a form of dynamic programming, storing intermediate results to avoid redundant computations.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **Initialization:**
    * `n`: Stores the length of the string.
    * `l`, `lc`, `lct`: Variables to count the number of 'L', 'LC', and 'LCT' subsequences respectively.  This initial counts are for subsequences without insertion.
* **First Loop:**  This loop iterates through the string and counts the subsequences without insertion.  If a character is 'L', the 'L' count increments. If it's 'C', the number of 'LC' subsequences is increased by the current number of 'L's. Similarly, if it's 'T', the 'LCT' count increases by the current number of 'LC's.
* **Prefix and Suffix Arrays:**  The arrays `preL`, `preLC`, `sufT`, and `sufCT` store prefix and suffix sums to efficiently find the impact of potential insertions.
    * `preL[i]`: Number of 'L's from index 0 to `i`.
    * `preLC[i]`: Number of 'LC' subsequences from index 0 to `i`.
    * `sufT[i]`: Number of 'T's from index `i` to the end.
    * `sufCT[i]`: Number of 'CT' subsequences from index `i` to the end.
* **Second Loop (Prefix Calculation):**  This loop populates the prefix arrays. It iteratively adds the counts of 'L' and 'LC' subsequences up to each index.
* **Third Loop (Suffix Calculation):** This loop populates the suffix arrays in a similar manner as the second loop, calculating from the end of the string towards the beginning.
* **Max Calculation:** This section iterates to find the maximum possible 'LCT' subsequences achievable by inserting one character. It considers three possibilities for each position `i`:
    1. Inserting 'C' between 'L's (counted by the suffix).
    2. Inserting 'C' between prefix 'L' and suffix 'T'.
    3. Inserting 'L' and then 'C' and then 'T'.
* **Final Return:** The function returns `lct + max`, representing the total number of subsequences after potentially inserting one character.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string.  The loops iterate through the string once, and the array calculations are linear.
* **Space Complexity:** O(n). This is due to the four arrays (`preL`, `preLC`, `sufT`, `sufCT`) each of size n+1.

The algorithm is efficient because it avoids exploring all possible insertion points and character choices; instead, it cleverly pre-computes relevant information using prefix and suffix sums, leading to a linear time solution.
