## Minimum Equal Sum of Two Arrays After Replacing Zeros: Detailed Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem presents two integer arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`.  We are allowed to replace all the zeros in each array with any positive integer.  The goal is to find the *minimum* possible equal sum that can be achieved for both arrays after replacing the zeros.  If it's impossible to achieve an equal sum, we should return -1.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The key idea is to understand how replacing zeros affects the sum.  We want to minimize the final sum, so we should ideally replace each zero with the smallest possible positive integer, which is 1.

However, if we simply replace all zeros with 1, the sums of the two arrays might not be equal.  To achieve equality, we must increase the smaller sum.  Therefore, we calculate the sum of each array assuming each zero is replaced by 1.  If one of the arrays has a sum that is already larger than the other and has no zeros to increment it, it's impossible to achieve equality, thus returning -1. Otherwise, the larger of the two sums, calculated by treating all the zeroes as 1, is the minimum possible equal sum.

For example:
* `nums1 = [1, 2, 0]` and `nums2 = [0, 3, 1]`.  
* Replacing zeros with 1:  `nums1` becomes `[1, 2, 1]` (sum = 4), and `nums2` becomes `[1, 3, 1]` (sum = 5).
* The final equal sum will be `max(4, 5) = 5`. We can make `nums1` sum to `5` by replacing the `0` with `2`.

Now, let us consider the case when it is impossible to achieve the equal sum.
* `nums1 = [1, 2, 3]` and `nums2 = [0, 3, 1]`.
* Replacing zeros with 1: `nums1` has a sum of 6. `nums2` becomes `[1, 3, 1]` (sum = 5).
* Because `nums1` does not have any zeros, we cannot increment its sum. `nums2` can have its sum incremented up to `6` by replacing the zero by `2`, achieving the equal sum.
* Now let's consider `nums1 = [0, 2, 3]` and `nums2 = [3, 1]`.
* Replacing zeros with 1: `nums1` becomes `[1, 2, 3]` (sum = 6). `nums2` has a sum of `4`.
* `nums1` can be further incremented and achieve equality.

However, if `nums1 = [1, 2, 3]` and `nums2 = [0, 0, 1]`.
* Replacing zeros with 1: `nums1` has a sum of `6`. `nums2` becomes `[1, 1, 1]` (sum = 3).
* Even if we increase both zeros with arbitrary positive values, it will always be possible to match `6`. This is because `nums2` has zeros that allow it to increment up to `6`.

If `nums1 = [0, 0, 1]` and `nums2 = [1, 2, 3]`.
* Replacing zeros with 1: `nums1` becomes `[1, 1, 1]` (sum = 3). `nums2` has a sum of `6`.
* If `nums1` has no zeros and a larger sum than `nums2`, it is impossible to make `nums1` decrement to the value of `nums2` without violating the constraints of the problem (replacing with positive integers). `nums2` does not contain zeros, so we cannot increment it either.
* Thus, the conditions for impossibility are `s1 > s2 && z2 == 0` or `s2 > s1 && z1 == 0`

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:**  Primarily uses integers and long to store sums and counts. No complex data structures are needed.
*   **Algorithms:**  Basic arithmetic operations (addition, comparison, `Math.max`).  The core logic is based on a greedy approach where zeros are initially replaced by 1 to minimize the sum.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public long minSum(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        long s1 = 0;
        long s2 = 0;
        long z1 = 0;
        long z2 = 0;
        for(int v : nums1) {
            s1 += (long)v;
            if(v == 0) {
                z1++;
                s1++;
            }
        }
        for(int v : nums2) {
            s2 += (long)v;
            if(v == 0) {
                z2++;
                s2++;
            }
        }
        if((s1 > s2 && z2 == 0) || (s2 > s1 && z1 == 0)) return -1;
        return Math.max(s1,s2);
    }
}
```

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   `s1`, `s2`: Long variables to store the sums of `nums1` and `nums2` respectively. Using `long` is crucial to prevent integer overflow, as the sums can be large.
    *   `z1`, `z2`: Long variables to store the counts of zeros in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.  Using `long` is safe because the length of array cannot exceed `10^5` based on the problem's constraints.

2.  **First Loop (Calculating sum of nums1):**
    *   `for(int v : nums1)`: Iterates through each element `v` in `nums1`.
    *   `s1 += (long)v;`: Adds the current element `v` to the sum `s1`. Casting to `long` is important here to avoid integer overflow.
    *   `if(v == 0)`: Checks if the current element is zero.
        *   `z1++;`: If it's zero, increment the count of zeros `z1`.
        *   `s1++;`: Crucially, *increment `s1` by 1*.  This represents replacing the zero with the smallest possible positive integer (1) when calculating the initial sums.

3.  **Second Loop (Calculating sum of nums2):**
    *   This loop is identical to the first, but operates on `nums2`, calculating `s2` (the sum of `nums2` after replacing zeros with 1) and `z2` (the number of zeros in `nums2`).

4.  **Impossibility Check:**
    *   `if((s1 > s2 && z2 == 0) || (s2 > s1 && z1 == 0)) return -1;`: This is the crucial condition to determine if an equal sum is impossible.
        *   `(s1 > s2 && z2 == 0)`:  Checks if `s1` (the sum of `nums1` after replacing zeros with 1) is already greater than `s2`, and `nums2` contains no zeros (`z2 == 0`). If this is true, then there are no more changes that can be done to array `nums2`, so the equal sum is impossible to achieve.
        *   `(s2 > s1 && z1 == 0)`:  Checks if `s2` is greater than `s1`, and `nums1` contains no zeros (`z1 == 0`). Similar to the previous case, there are no more changes that can be done to array `nums1`, so the equal sum is impossible to achieve.
        *   If either of these conditions is true, the function returns `-1`.

5.  **Return Minimum Equal Sum:**
    *   `return Math.max(s1,s2);`: If an equal sum is possible, this line returns the maximum of `s1` and `s2`.  This is because, by replacing zeros with 1, we have guaranteed that the sum of the array with the smaller sum will be incremented until it equals the larger one. Thus, `max(s1, s2)` is the minimum possible equal sum.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the total number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2`.  The code iterates through each array once.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1). The code uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the size of the input arrays. The variables `s1`, `s2`, `z1`, and `z2` take up a fixed amount of space.
