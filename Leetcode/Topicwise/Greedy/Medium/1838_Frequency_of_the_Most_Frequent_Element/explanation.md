## LeetCode: Frequency of the Most Frequent Element - Detailed Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the maximum frequency of an element in an array `nums` such that we can make all elements within a subarray equal by using at most `k` operations.  Each operation allows us to increase the value of a single element by 1.  The goal is to find the length of the longest subarray where this is possible.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution utilizes a two-pointer sliding window approach coupled with sorting.  We sort the array first because this allows us to efficiently determine the maximum frequency.  If we have a sorted array and choose a rightmost element as the target element, all elements to its left are smaller or equal, thus minimizing the number of operations needed to make them equal to the rightmost element.

The `while` loop manages the sliding window. It shrinks the window from the left (`l`) whenever the cost of making all elements in the current window equal to the rightmost element (`nums[r]`) exceeds `k`.  This cost is calculated as `(r - l + 1) * nums[r] - sum`, where `sum` is the sum of all elements in the window.

This approach is chosen because it efficiently explores all possible subarrays while keeping track of the cost to make them uniform. A brute-force approach checking all possible subarrays would be significantly less efficient.

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**  The primary data structure used is an array (`nums`).
* **Algorithms:** The core algorithm is a two-pointer sliding window technique.  Sorting is used as a preprocessing step to improve efficiency.

**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **`int l = 0; int ans = 0; long sum = 0;`**:  Initializes variables. `l` is the left pointer of the sliding window, `ans` stores the maximum frequency found so far, and `sum` keeps track of the sum of elements within the window.  `sum` is declared as `long` to prevent integer overflow.

* **`Arrays.sort(nums);`**: Sorts the input array `nums` in ascending order.  This is crucial for the efficiency of the algorithm.

* **`for(int r = 0; r<nums.length; r++) { ... }`**: This loop iterates through the array using `r` as the right pointer of the sliding window.

* **`sum+=nums[r];`**: Adds the current element (`nums[r]`) to the `sum` of the window.

* **`while((long)(r-l+1)*nums[r]-sum > k) { ... }`**: This is the core logic of the sliding window. It checks if the cost of making all elements in the window equal to `nums[r]` exceeds `k`.  If it does, the window is shrunk from the left.

* **`sum-=nums[l]; l++;`**: Removes the leftmost element (`nums[l]`) from the window's sum and moves the left pointer (`l`) one step to the right.

* **`ans = Math.max(ans, r-l+1);`**: Updates `ans` to the maximum window size (frequency) encountered so far.

* **`return ans;`**: Returns the maximum frequency.

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(N log N), where N is the length of `nums`.  This is dominated by the sorting step (`Arrays.sort()`). The sliding window iteration takes O(N) time in the worst case.

* **Space Complexity:** O(1). The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input size.  We are not using any additional data structures that scale with the input size.  Note that the in-place sorting used by `Arrays.sort()` might use a small amount of extra space depending on the implementation, but this is typically considered constant space in Big O notation.
