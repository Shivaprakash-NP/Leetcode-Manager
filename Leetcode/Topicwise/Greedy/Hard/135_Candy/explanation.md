## Candy Problem Explanation

Here's a detailed explanation of the provided Java code for the LeetCode "Candy" problem.

### 1. Problem Understanding

The "Candy" problem states that you are given an array `ratings` representing the ratings of children standing in a line. You need to distribute candies to these children with the following constraints:

*   Each child must receive at least one candy.
*   Children with higher ratings get more candies than their immediate neighbors.

The objective is to find the minimum number of candies needed to satisfy these conditions.

### 2. Approach / Intuition

The core idea behind the solution is to perform two passes through the `ratings` array.

*   **First Pass (Left to Right):** This pass ensures that children with higher ratings than their left neighbor receive more candies than their left neighbor. We start by assigning each child 1 candy. Then, we iterate from left to right. If a child's rating is higher than the previous child's rating, we update the child's candy count to be one more than the previous child's candy count.

*   **Second Pass (Right to Left):** This pass handles the right neighbor constraint. We iterate from right to left. If a child's rating is higher than the next child's rating, we update the child's candy count to be the *maximum* of its current candy count and one more than the next child's candy count.  The `Math.max` function ensures that we maintain the condition met in the first pass (if a child also has a higher rating than their left neighbor, they still get more candies than the left neighbor).

By performing these two passes, we guarantee that both neighboring constraints are satisfied. Finally, we sum up all the candy counts to find the minimum total number of candies needed.

This approach is chosen because it efficiently addresses both left and right neighbor constraints in a systematic manner. Other approaches might involve sorting or complex comparisons, leading to higher time complexity. This two-pass approach provides a relatively simple and efficient way to solve the problem.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms

*   **Data Structure:** `int[] ans`: An integer array `ans` of the same size as `ratings` is used to store the number of candies assigned to each child.
*   **Algorithm:**
    *   **Array Traversal (Two Passes):**  The solution uses two `for` loops to iterate through the `ratings` array, once from left to right and once from right to left.
    *   **Dynamic Programming (Implicit):** The `ans` array is built up based on the neighboring values.  The number of candies a child receives depends on the candies received by its neighbors, making it an implicit dynamic programming approach.

### 4. Code Walkthrough

```java
class Solution {
    public int candy(int[] ratings) {
        int n = ratings.length;
        int[] ans = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(ans, 1);
        int cnt = 0;
        for(int i = 1 ; i<n ; i++) {
            if(ratings[i]>ratings[i-1]) ans[i] = ans[i-1]+1;
        }
        for(int i = n-2 ; i>=0 ; i--) {
            if(ratings[i]>ratings[i+1]) ans[i] = Math.max(ans[i] , ans[i+1]+1);
            cnt += ans[i];
        }
        return cnt+ans[n-1];
    }
}
```

1.  **`class Solution { ... }`**:  This is the standard class declaration for a LeetCode solution in Java.

2.  **`public int candy(int[] ratings) { ... }`**: This defines the `candy` method, which takes an integer array `ratings` as input and returns the minimum number of candies needed.

3.  **`int n = ratings.length;`**: Gets the length of the `ratings` array and stores it in the variable `n`.

4.  **`int[] ans = new int[n];`**: Creates a new integer array `ans` of size `n`. This array will store the number of candies assigned to each child.

5.  **`Arrays.fill(ans, 1);`**: Initializes all elements of the `ans` array to 1. This ensures that each child initially receives at least one candy.

6.  **`int cnt = 0;`**: Initializes a counter `cnt` to 0. This variable will accumulate the total number of candies, starting from the second loop.

7.  **`for(int i = 1 ; i<n ; i++) { ... }`**:  The first `for` loop iterates through the `ratings` array from left to right, starting from the second element (index 1).

8.  **`if(ratings[i]>ratings[i-1]) ans[i] = ans[i-1]+1;`**:  Inside the first loop, this `if` statement checks if the current child's rating (`ratings[i]`) is greater than the previous child's rating (`ratings[i-1]`). If it is, it means the current child should receive more candies than the previous child.  Therefore, `ans[i]` is updated to `ans[i-1] + 1`.

9.  **`for(int i = n-2 ; i>=0 ; i--) { ... }`**: The second `for` loop iterates through the `ratings` array from right to left, starting from the second to last element (index `n-2`).

10. **`if(ratings[i]>ratings[i+1]) ans[i] = Math.max(ans[i] , ans[i+1]+1);`**: Inside the second loop, this `if` statement checks if the current child's rating (`ratings[i]`) is greater than the next child's rating (`ratings[i+1]`). If it is, it means the current child should receive more candies than the next child.  We use `Math.max` to ensure that if `ans[i]` was already increased in the previous loop due to the left neighbor, we choose the bigger value between current `ans[i]` and  `ans[i+1] + 1`.

11. **`cnt += ans[i];`**: After checking the right neighbor condition, the current child's candy count (`ans[i]`) is added to the `cnt` variable.

12. **`return cnt+ans[n-1];`**: After the second loop finishes, the function returns the total number of candies. We need to add `ans[n-1]` because it was not included in the loop.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of children (length of the `ratings` array). The code iterates through the array twice, so the time complexity is linear.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of children. The code uses an auxiliary array `ans` of size `n` to store the number of candies for each child.
