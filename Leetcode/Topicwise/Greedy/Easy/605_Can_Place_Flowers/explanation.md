## LeetCode: Can Place Flowers - Solution Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks whether we can plant `n` new flowers in a flowerbed represented by an integer array.  A flower can only be planted in a `0` (empty) plot, and it cannot be planted adjacent to another flower (i.e., there must be empty plots on both sides, or it's at the edge of the flowerbed). The goal is to determine if we can plant `n` flowers under these constraints.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution uses a greedy approach.  It iterates through the `flowerbed` array.  For each empty plot (`0`), it checks if planting a flower there is possible (i.e., it has empty plots or is at the edge on both sides). If it's possible, the solution plants the flower (sets the plot to `1`) and decrements the number of flowers needed to plant (`n`).  Finally, it checks if `n` has become less than or equal to 0; if so, it means we could plant all the required flowers.  This greedy approach is optimal because planting flowers as early as possible maximizes the chances of planting all `n` flowers.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structure:** The primary data structure used is an integer array (`flowerbed`) to represent the flowerbed.
* **Algorithm:** The algorithm is a greedy approach combined with a single pass iteration through the array.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean canPlaceFlowers(int[] flowerbed, int n) {
        for (int i = 0; i < flowerbed.length; i++) { // Iterate through the flowerbed
            if (flowerbed[i] == 0) { // Check if the current plot is empty
                boolean l = (i == 0) || (flowerbed[i - 1] == 0); // Check if the left neighbor is empty or doesn't exist
                boolean r = (i == flowerbed.length - 1) || (flowerbed[i + 1] == 0); // Check if the right neighbor is empty or doesn't exist
                if (l && r) { // If both left and right neighbors are empty or don't exist
                    flowerbed[i] = 1; // Plant a flower
                    n--; // Decrement the number of flowers to plant
                }
            }
        }
        return 0 >= n; // Return true if all flowers could be planted, false otherwise
    }
}
```

* **`for` loop:** This loop iterates through each plot in the `flowerbed` array.
* **`if (flowerbed[i] == 0)`:** This condition checks if the current plot is empty (available for planting).
* **`boolean l = (i == 0) || (flowerbed[i - 1] == 0);` and `boolean r = (i == flowerbed.length - 1) || (flowerbed[i + 1] == 0);`:** These lines check the left and right neighbors of the current plot. The `||` (or) operator handles boundary conditions: if the plot is at the beginning or end of the array, it doesn't have a left or right neighbor, respectively, so the condition is automatically true.
* **`if (l && r)`:** This checks if both the left and right conditions are met (i.e., we can plant a flower).
* **`flowerbed[i] = 1;` and `n--;`:** If we can plant a flower, we set the plot to `1` (planted) and decrement `n`.
* **`return 0 >= n;`:** This line returns `true` if `n` is less than or equal to 0 (meaning we successfully planted all the required flowers), and `false` otherwise.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the length of the `flowerbed` array. The code iterates through the array once.
* **Space Complexity:** O(1). The solution uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input size.  It only uses a few boolean variables for temporary storage.


This solution efficiently solves the "Can Place Flowers" problem using a simple, linear-time greedy approach, making it suitable for LeetCode's time and space constraints.
