## LeetCode: Longest Valid Parentheses - Solution Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the length of the longest valid substring containing only matching parentheses within a given string `s` consisting of '(' and ')'.  A valid substring means every opening parenthesis '(' has a corresponding closing parenthesis ')' and they are properly nested.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

This solution uses a stack and a binary array (`bin`) to efficiently identify valid parenthesis pairs.  The core idea is:

* We iterate through the string.  If we encounter an opening parenthesis '(', we push its index onto the stack.
* If we encounter a closing parenthesis ')', and the stack is not empty (meaning there's a matching opening parenthesis), we pop the index of the opening parenthesis from the stack.  We then mark both the opening and closing parenthesis indices in the `bin` array as 1, indicating they form a valid pair.
* Parentheses that don't have a match (either because the stack is empty when encountering a ')' or because there are unmatched '(' at the end) will remain marked as 0 in `bin`.

Finally, we iterate through `bin` to count consecutive 1s, representing the lengths of valid parenthesis substrings, and return the maximum length found. This approach avoids the need for recursive or complex dynamic programming solutions and provides a relatively simple and efficient solution.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Stack:** Used to store the indices of opening parentheses encountered so far. This allows us to quickly find matching closing parentheses.  A `Stack<Integer>` is used in Java.
* **Array (`bin`):** A binary array to mark indices of valid parentheses as 1. This simplifies finding the length of the longest valid substring.
* **Iteration:** The algorithm iterates through the input string once to build the `bin` array and a second time to find the maximum length of consecutive 1s.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestValidParentheses(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int[] bin = new int[n]; // Binary array to mark valid parentheses
        Stack<Integer> st = new Stack<>(); // Stack to store indices of '('
        for(int i = 0 ; i<s.length() ; i++) { // Iterate through the string
            if(s.charAt(i) == '(') st.push(i); // Push index of '(' onto stack
            else if(!st.isEmpty()) { // If ')' and stack is not empty
                bin[i] = 1; // Mark ')' as valid
                bin[st.pop()] = 1; // Mark matching '(' as valid
            }
        }
        int c = 0; // Counter for consecutive valid parentheses
        int ans = 0; // Length of longest valid substring
        for(int v : bin) { // Iterate through the binary array
            if(v == 1) c++; // Increment counter if valid
            else { // If not valid
                ans = Math.max(ans , c); // Update max length
                c = 0; // Reset counter
            }
        }
        ans = Math.max(ans , c); // Handle trailing valid parentheses
        return ans; // Return max length
    }
}
```

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string.  We iterate through the string twice: once to build the `bin` array and once to find the maximum length of consecutive 1s.  Stack operations (push and pop) take constant time on average.

* **Space Complexity:** O(n) in the worst case. The `bin` array has size n.  In the worst-case scenario (e.g., string containing only '('), the stack can also store up to n indices.  However, on average, space usage will be less than O(n).


**Improvements and potential edge cases:**  The code is efficient and handles most cases correctly. A minor improvement could be adding a check for an empty input string to prevent potential `NullPointerExceptions` or array index out-of-bounds errors.  However, in the context of LeetCode, which usually pre-screens inputs, this isn't strictly necessary.
