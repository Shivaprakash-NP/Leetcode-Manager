## Valid Parentheses - Detailed Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The "Valid Parentheses" problem asks us to determine if a given string `s` containing only parentheses ('(', ')', '{', '}', '[', ']') is valid. A string is considered valid if:

1.  Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2.  Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
3.  Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

In essence, we need to check if the parentheses are properly nested and balanced.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is to use a stack to keep track of the opening parentheses encountered. When we encounter a closing parenthesis, we check if the stack is empty (meaning there's no corresponding open parenthesis) or if the top element of the stack is the corresponding opening parenthesis.

*   If the stack is empty or the top element is not the corresponding opening parenthesis, the string is invalid.
*   If the top element is the corresponding opening parenthesis, we pop it from the stack, indicating that the pair is matched.

At the end, if the stack is empty, it means all opening parentheses have been matched with their corresponding closing parentheses, and the string is valid. If the stack is not empty, it means there are unmatched opening parentheses, and the string is invalid.

Why a stack?  The Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) nature of a stack perfectly suits the nested structure of parentheses.  The most recently opened parenthesis needs to be closed *first*.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structure:** `Deque` (used as a stack).  We use a `Deque` (Double-Ended Queue) because it provides both stack and queue functionalities.  `ArrayDeque` is an efficient implementation of `Deque` that avoids the overhead of linked lists.
*   **Algorithm:** Stack-based parenthesis matching.  This involves iterating through the string and using the stack's push and pop operations to maintain the order and matching of parentheses.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isValid(String s) {
        Deque<Character> val = new ArrayDeque<>(); // Initialize a Deque to act as a stack
        for(char c : s.toCharArray()) { // Iterate through each character in the string
            if(c == ']') { // If the character is a closing square bracket
                if(!val.isEmpty()) { // Check if the stack is not empty
                    if(val.peek() != '[') return false; // Check if the top of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket
                    else val.pop(); // If it is, pop the opening bracket from the stack
                } else return false; // If the stack is empty, there is no corresponding opening bracket, so return false
            } else if(c == ')') { // If the character is a closing parenthesis
                if(!val.isEmpty()) { // Check if the stack is not empty
                    if(val.peek() != '(') return false; // Check if the top of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket
                    else val.pop(); // If it is, pop the opening bracket from the stack
                } else return false; // If the stack is empty, there is no corresponding opening bracket, so return false
            } else if(c == '}') { // If the character is a closing curly brace
                if(!val.isEmpty()) { // Check if the stack is not empty
                    if(val.peek() != '{') return false; // Check if the top of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket
                    else val.pop(); // If it is, pop the opening bracket from the stack
                } else return false; // If the stack is empty, there is no corresponding opening bracket, so return false
            } else val.push(c); // If the character is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack
        }
        return (val.size()==0)?true:false; // Check if the stack is empty at the end. If it is, the string is valid. Otherwise, it is invalid.
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Deque<Character> val = new ArrayDeque<>();`**:  A `Deque` named `val` is initialized as an `ArrayDeque`. This will serve as our stack to store opening parentheses.  We use `Character` because we are storing characters representing parentheses.
2.  **`for(char c : s.toCharArray())`**: This loop iterates through each character `c` in the input string `s`.
3.  **`if(c == ']')`**: This block handles closing square brackets `]`.
    *   **`if(!val.isEmpty())`**: It first checks if the stack is empty. If it is, there's no corresponding opening bracket, so the string is invalid (`return false`).
    *   **`if(val.peek() != '[') return false;`**: If the stack is not empty, it checks if the top element of the stack (`val.peek()`) is the corresponding opening bracket `[`. If it's not, the string is invalid (`return false`).
    *   **`else val.pop();`**: If the top of the stack is the correct opening bracket, it means we found a matching pair, so we remove the opening bracket from the stack (`val.pop()`).
4.  **`else if(c == ')')`** and **`else if(c == '}')`**: These blocks are similar to the `if(c == ']')` block but handle closing parentheses `)` and closing curly braces `}` respectively.  They perform the same checks and stack operations based on the correct corresponding opening parenthesis.
5.  **`else val.push(c);`**: If the character `c` is an opening parenthesis (`(`, `[`, or `{`), it's pushed onto the stack (`val.push(c)`).
6.  **`return (val.size()==0)?true:false;`**: After processing all characters, this line checks if the stack is empty.
    *   If the stack is empty (`val.size()==0`), it means all opening parentheses have been matched with their corresponding closing parentheses, so the string is valid (`return true`).
    *   If the stack is not empty, it means there are unmatched opening parentheses, so the string is invalid (`return false`).

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`. This is because we iterate through the string once. Each operation within the loop (stack push, pop, peek, isEmpty) takes O(1) time.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(n) in the worst-case scenario.  This occurs when the input string contains only opening parentheses. In this case, the stack will store all the opening parentheses, and the stack's size will be proportional to n.  In the best-case (e.g., "()()()"), the space complexity would be closer to O(1), but the worst-case determines the overall space complexity.
