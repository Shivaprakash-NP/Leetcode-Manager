## Palindrome Linked List

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to determine whether a given singly linked list is a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same forwards and backward. In the context of a linked list, this means the sequence of values in the list must be the same when traversed from head to tail and from tail to head (conceptually, as we can't directly traverse backward).

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The chosen approach involves three main steps:

1.  **Find the middle of the linked list:**  We use the fast and slow pointer technique to efficiently find the middle node.  The fast pointer moves twice as fast as the slow pointer. When the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer will be at the middle of the list (or the first node of the second half if the list has an even number of nodes).
2.  **Reverse the second half of the linked list:**  Starting from the node after the middle node, we reverse the direction of the pointers in the second half of the list. This transforms the second half into a reversed version of itself.
3.  **Compare the first half with the reversed second half:**  We then iterate through the first half of the original list and the reversed second half, comparing the values of corresponding nodes. If any values differ, the linked list is not a palindrome. If we reach the end of both halves without finding any differences, the list is a palindrome.

This approach is preferred because it modifies the linked list *in-place* (reversing the second half) without needing to use extra space to copy the list or its elements into auxiliary data structures (like an array).

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Linked List:** The primary data structure is the singly linked list itself.
*   **Fast and Slow Pointers:** This technique is used to efficiently find the middle of the linked list.
*   **Linked List Reversal:** An iterative approach is employed to reverse the second half of the linked list.
*   **Two Pointers:**  Used again to traverse and compare the first half of the original list with the reversed second half.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(ListNode head) {
        ListNode s = head;
        ListNode f = head;
        while(f.next != null && f.next.next != null)
        {
            s = s.next;
            f = f.next.next;
        }
        ListNode pre = null;
        ListNode cur = s.next;
        while(cur != null)
        {
            ListNode temp = cur.next;
            cur.next = pre;
            pre = cur;
            cur = temp;
        }
        ListNode st = head;
        ListNode nxt = pre;
        while(st != null && nxt != null)
        {
            if(st.val != nxt.val) return false;
            st = st.next;
            nxt = nxt.next;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

*   **`ListNode s = head;` and `ListNode f = head;`:** Initialize two pointers, `s` (slow) and `f` (fast), both starting at the head of the linked list.

*   **`while(f.next != null && f.next.next != null)`:** This loop moves the `s` and `f` pointers. The condition ensures that the loop continues as long as the fast pointer `f` has at least two more nodes ahead of it. This condition handles both even and odd length lists correctly.
    *   `s = s.next;`: The slow pointer moves one step forward.
    *   `f = f.next.next;`: The fast pointer moves two steps forward.
    *   After this loop, `s` will be pointing to the middle node of the list.

*   **`ListNode pre = null;` and `ListNode cur = s.next;`:** `pre` will be used to keep track of the previous node during the reversal process, starting as null. `cur` is the node to be reversed, starting from the node after the middle (s.next).

*   **`while(cur != null)`:** This loop reverses the second half of the linked list.
    *   `ListNode temp = cur.next;`: Store the next node of `cur` in `temp` to avoid losing the reference.
    *   `cur.next = pre;`: Reverse the pointer of `cur` to point to the previous node (`pre`).
    *   `pre = cur;`: Move `pre` one step forward to `cur`.
    *   `cur = temp;`: Move `cur` one step forward to `temp`.
    *   After this loop, `pre` will point to the new head of the reversed second half.

*   **`ListNode st = head;` and `ListNode nxt = pre;`:**  `st` starts at the beginning of the original list (`head`), and `nxt` starts at the beginning of the reversed second half (`pre`).

*   **`while(st != null && nxt != null)`:** This loop compares the values of the nodes in the first half of the original list and the reversed second half.
    *   `if(st.val != nxt.val) return false;`: If the values are different, it's not a palindrome, so return `false`.
    *   `st = st.next;`: Move `st` to the next node in the first half.
    *   `nxt = nxt.next;`: Move `nxt` to the next node in the reversed second half.

*   **`return true;`:** If the loop completes without finding any differences, the linked list is a palindrome, so return `true`.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list.
    *   Finding the middle: O(N/2) which is O(N)
    *   Reversing the second half: O(N/2) which is O(N)
    *   Comparing the two halves: O(N/2) which is O(N)

*   **Space Complexity:** O(1). The algorithm modifies the linked list in-place by reversing the second half.  It uses only a constant amount of extra space for pointers (`s`, `f`, `pre`, `cur`, `st`, `nxt`, `temp`). No auxiliary data structures that scale with the input size are used.
