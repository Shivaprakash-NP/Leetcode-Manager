Okay, I will analyze the provided Java code for the LeetCode problem "Make Array Non-decreasing".

## Make Array Non-decreasing

### 1. Problem Understanding

The problem asks us to find the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence within the given input array `nums`. We need to determine how many elements can be selected from the array such that they form a non-decreasing sequence. "Non-decreasing" means that each element in the subsequence must be greater than or equal to the element preceding it.  We want to return the maximum possible length of such a subsequence.

### 2. Approach / Intuition

The code uses a simple, greedy approach. The intuition is that to build the longest non-decreasing subsequence, we should always try to include the current element if it allows us to maintain the non-decreasing property. We iterate through the array, keeping track of the last element included in our subsequence (`p`). If the current element is greater than or equal to the last element included, we add it to our subsequence and update the last element. This builds the longest possible non-decreasing subsequence in a single pass.  We are essentially finding the longest subsequence that is already non-decreasing in the given order.

Why this approach? Because the problem doesn't ask for the actual longest non-decreasing subsequence if elements were reordered. It implicitly asks for the maximum length achievable by traversing elements in the same order as they are initially given. If we had to consider reordering, the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) algorithms using dynamic programming or patience sorting would be appropriate.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms

*   **Data Structures:** No complex data structures are used. The solution uses only integer variables (`c`, `p`, `i`) and the input array `nums`.
*   **Algorithms:** The solution implements a simple greedy algorithm. It iterates through the array once, making a local optimal choice at each step (including the current element if it maintains the non-decreasing property).

### 4. Code Walkthrough

```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumPossibleSize(int[] nums) {
        int c = 1; // Initialize the count of elements in the non-decreasing subsequence to 1
                     // since the first element can always be part of the sequence.
        int p = nums[0]; // Initialize the 'previous' element (the last element included in the subsequence)
                         // to the first element of the input array.
        for(int i = 1 ; i<nums.length ; i++)
        {
            if(p<=nums[i]) // Check if the current element is greater than or equal to the previous element.
            {
                p = nums[i]; // If it is, update the 'previous' element to the current element,
                             // because we're including it in our subsequence.
                c++; // Increment the count of elements in the non-decreasing subsequence.
            }
        }
        return c; // Return the final count of elements in the non-decreasing subsequence.
    }
}
```

**Detailed Explanation:**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   `int c = 1;`:  `c` represents the length of the non-decreasing subsequence found so far.  It's initialized to 1 because the first element of `nums` is always included.
    *   `int p = nums[0];`: `p` stores the value of the last element added to the non-decreasing subsequence. Initially, it's set to the first element of the input array.

2.  **Iteration:**
    *   `for(int i = 1 ; i<nums.length ; i++)`:  The loop iterates through the array `nums` starting from the second element (index 1).

3.  **Non-decreasing Check:**
    *   `if(p<=nums[i])`:  This is the core of the greedy algorithm.  It checks if the current element `nums[i]` is greater than or equal to the last element included in the subsequence `p`.

4.  **Updating Subsequence:**
    *   `p = nums[i];`: If the condition `p <= nums[i]` is true, it means we can include the current element in our subsequence without violating the non-decreasing property.  We update `p` to `nums[i]` to reflect that `nums[i]` is now the last element included.
    *   `c++;`:  We increment `c` because we've added another element to our non-decreasing subsequence.

5.  **Return Value:**
    *   `return c;`: After iterating through the entire array, `c` contains the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence we found, and the function returns this value.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. The code iterates through the array only once.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1). The code uses only a few integer variables.  It doesn't use any extra data structures that scale with the size of the input.
