## LeetCode: Count Submatrices With All Ones - Solution Explained

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to count the number of submatrices within a given binary matrix (containing only 0s and 1s) where all elements within the submatrix are 1s.  We need to find all possible rectangular submatrices that satisfy this condition.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

This solution uses a dynamic programming approach combined with a clever iteration technique.  Instead of directly checking all possible submatrices (which would be O(n^4)), it leverages the following idea:

* **Height Matrix (`hei`)**: It first constructs a matrix `hei` where `hei[i][j]` represents the height of a column of 1s ending at position `(i, j)`. This is efficiently calculated using the previous row's height information.  If `mat[i][j] == 0`, the height is 0; otherwise, it's `hei[i-1][j] + 1`.

* **Iterative Counting**: The code then iterates through each row. For each cell, it considers all possible submatrices that have that cell as their top-right corner.  It finds the minimum height among the cells to the left of the current cell within the same row. This minimum height determines the width of the submatrix with all 1s that can be formed. The number of such submatrices is equal to the minimum height. This process is repeated for each cell as a potential top-right corner.

This approach is chosen because it reduces the time complexity significantly by avoiding redundant calculations. It efficiently computes the height of consecutive 1s in each column and then uses this information to count submatrices in a linear fashion.

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**  A 2D array (`int[][]`) is used to represent both the input matrix (`mat`) and the height matrix (`hei`).
* **Algorithms:** Dynamic programming is the core algorithm used to calculate the height matrix.  The nested loops implement an iterative approach to count the submatrices.

**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **Initialization:**
    * `n` and `m` store the dimensions of the input matrix.
    * `ans` initializes the count of submatrices to 0.
    * `hei` is created to store the height of 1s columns. The first row of `hei` is directly copied from the first row of `mat`.

* **Dynamic Programming (Height Calculation):**
    * The nested loops iterate through the matrix, calculating the height of 1s columns in `hei`.  `hei[i][j]` is set to 0 if `mat[i][j]` is 0, otherwise it's `hei[i-1][j] + 1`. This efficiently captures the height of consecutive 1s in each column.

* **Submatrix Counting:**
    * The outer two loops iterate through each cell as a potential top-right corner of a submatrix.
    * `min` keeps track of the minimum height encountered while traversing leftwards from the current cell.
    * The inner loop iterates leftwards from the current cell.  `min` is updated with the minimum height encountered so far.
    * `ans += min;` adds the number of submatrices that can be formed using the current cell as the top-right corner and the minimum height found.


* **Return Value:**
    * The function returns `ans`, which represents the total count of submatrices with all 1s.

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(n*m*m). The nested loops have a time complexity of O(n*m*m) due to the innermost loop which iterates up to 'm' times for each cell. The dynamic programming part is O(n*m).  Therefore, the overall time complexity is dominated by the submatrix counting part.

* **Space Complexity:** O(n*m). The space is mainly consumed by the `hei` matrix which has the same dimensions as the input matrix. The other variables use constant space.


In summary, this solution cleverly uses dynamic programming to pre-compute the height of 1s columns, enabling an efficient iterative approach to count all submatrices with all ones.  The time complexity is O(n*m*m), an improvement over the naive O(n^4) approach.
