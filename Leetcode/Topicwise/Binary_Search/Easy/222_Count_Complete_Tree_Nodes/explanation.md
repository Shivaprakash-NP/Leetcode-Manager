## LeetCode: Count Complete Tree Nodes - Detailed Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to count the total number of nodes in a complete binary tree. A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution uses a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach using a queue.  BFS is a natural fit for traversing a tree level by level.  We iterate through the tree level by level, counting the nodes at each level. This approach ensures we visit every node exactly once, making it efficient for counting nodes.  Other approaches like recursion might be less efficient due to repeated traversal of subtrees.

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * `TreeNode`:  A standard node structure for a binary tree, holding an integer value and references to left and right children.
    * `Queue<TreeNode>` (specifically `LinkedList` in this implementation): A queue is used to implement the BFS traversal.  Nodes are added to the rear of the queue and removed from the front.

* **Algorithms:**
    * **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** A graph traversal algorithm that explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.

**4. Code Walkthrough:**

```java
class Solution {
    public int countNodes(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return 0; // Base case: Empty tree has 0 nodes

        Queue<TreeNode> q = new LinkedList<>(); // Initialize a queue for BFS
        int ans = 0; // Initialize the node count
        q.offer(root); // Add the root node to the queue

        while (!q.isEmpty()) { // Continue until the queue is empty
            int n = q.size(); // Get the number of nodes at the current level
            ans += n; // Add the number of nodes at this level to the total count

            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { // Process each node at the current level
                TreeNode node = q.poll(); // Remove the node from the queue
                if (node.left != null) q.offer(node.left); // Add left child if it exists
                if (node.right != null) q.offer(node.right); // Add right child if it exists
            }
        }

        return ans; // Return the total node count
    }
}
```


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.  Each node is visited and processed exactly once.

* **Space Complexity:** O(W), where W is the maximum width of the tree. In the worst-case scenario (a complete binary tree), W could be O(N),  representing the maximum number of nodes at a given level. The queue stores nodes from a single level at a time. For a balanced tree, the space complexity is O(log N) because the maximum number of nodes at any level is logarithmic in the total number of nodes. For skewed trees, space complexity would approach O(N).  Therefore, it's best described as O(W), where W is the maximum width.  This is usually significantly smaller than N except in extremely unbalanced trees.


In summary, this BFS approach provides an efficient and clear solution for counting nodes in a complete binary tree.  The time complexity is linear with respect to the number of nodes, and the space complexity depends on the maximum width of the tree, making it a good choice for this problem.
