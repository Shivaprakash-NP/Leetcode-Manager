Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided Java code for the LeetCode "Missing Number" problem, explained in detail.

## Missing Number Problem Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem states that we are given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers taken from the range `[0, n]`.  Our task is to find the one number that is missing from the array. In simpler terms, if the array should have all numbers from 0 up to `n` (inclusive) and it's missing one, we need to find that missing number.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The solution leverages a clever mathematical trick to find the missing number efficiently. The key idea is:

1.  **Calculate the Expected Sum:** If the array contained *all* numbers from 0 to `n`, we could easily calculate the sum of all elements using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `n * (n - 1) / 2`.  Note that in the provided code, `n` represents the length of `nums` *plus one*, which is the upper bound of the range (inclusive).
2.  **Calculate the Actual Sum:** We calculate the sum of the numbers that are actually *present* in the given `nums` array.
3.  **Find the Difference:**  The difference between the expected sum and the actual sum *is* the missing number.

**Why this approach?** This approach is chosen because it avoids using extra data structures (like hash sets) or sorting the array, leading to a very efficient solution in terms of both time and space complexity. The arithmetic series formula provides a direct way to compute the expected sum, avoiding the need to iterate through the full range from 0 to `n`.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:** The core data structure is the input `int[] nums` array. No other auxiliary data structures are used.
*   **Algorithms:**  The algorithm mainly uses arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, and division) and a `for-each` loop for array traversal.  The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is the crucial mathematical component.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
class Solution {
    public int missingNumber(int[] nums) {
        int s = 0;
        int n = nums.length+1;
        for(int v : nums) s+=v;
        return (n*(n-1)/2 - s);
    }
}
```

*   **`import java.util.Arrays;`**: Although imported, this import statement is unused. It suggests that initially, the problem solver might have considered a solution using `Arrays.sort` or other array methods, but then opted for the mathematical approach.
*   **`class Solution { ... }`**: This defines the `Solution` class, which is standard in LeetCode submissions.
*   **`public int missingNumber(int[] nums) { ... }`**: This defines the `missingNumber` method, which takes an integer array `nums` as input and returns the missing integer.
*   **`int s = 0;`**:  Initializes an integer variable `s` to 0. This variable will store the sum of the elements in the `nums` array.
*   **`int n = nums.length+1;`**:  Initializes an integer variable `n` to the length of the `nums` array plus 1. This is the upper bound of the expected range of numbers (inclusive).
*   **`for(int v : nums) s+=v;`**: This is a `for-each` loop that iterates through each element `v` in the `nums` array. Inside the loop, `s += v` adds the value of the current element `v` to the sum `s`. After the loop completes, `s` will contain the sum of all elements in the `nums` array.
*   **`return (n*(n-1)/2 - s);`**: This line calculates the missing number and returns it.  It computes the expected sum of numbers from 0 to `n` using the formula `n * (n - 1) / 2`. Then, it subtracts the actual sum `s` (calculated in the previous loop) from the expected sum.  The result is the missing number.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the `nums` array.  The `for-each` loop iterates through the array once, performing constant-time operations within each iteration. The rest of the operations are arithmetic, taking constant time.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1). The solution uses only a few integer variables (`s`, `n`), regardless of the size of the input array.  Therefore, the space complexity is constant.
