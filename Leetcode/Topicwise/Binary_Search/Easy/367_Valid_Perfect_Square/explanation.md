## LeetCode Problem: Valid Perfect Square - Solution Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to determine whether a given positive integer `num` is a perfect square.  A perfect square is an integer that can be expressed as the square of another integer. For example, 9 is a perfect square because 3 * 3 = 9.  We need to return `true` if `num` is a perfect square, and `false` otherwise.  The challenge is to do this without using built-in square root functions.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea behind the solution is to use **binary search**. Since we are looking for an integer `x` such that `x * x = num`, we can search for `x` within a sorted range of integers. The range we search within is from 1 to `num` (inclusive) because the square root of any number cannot be greater than the number itself (assuming the number is >=1).  Binary search is an efficient algorithm for searching sorted data. In each step, we compare the square of the middle element `m` to the target number `num`.

- If `m * m == num`, we've found the square root, so we return `true`.
- If `m * m < num`, it means the actual square root (if it exists) is greater than `m`, so we search in the right half of the range (increase `l`).
- If `m * m > num`, it means the actual square root (if it exists) is less than `m`, so we search in the left half of the range (decrease `r`).

We chose binary search because it allows us to efficiently narrow down the search space by half in each iteration, providing a logarithmic time complexity.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

- **Data Structures:** No explicit data structures are used. The solution operates directly on integers.
- **Algorithms:**
    - **Binary Search:** The core algorithm used to efficiently search for the potential square root.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPerfectSquare(int num) {
        int l = 1; // Initialize the left boundary of the search range to 1.
        int r = num; // Initialize the right boundary of the search range to num.
        while(l<=r) { // Continue the loop as long as the left boundary is less than or equal to the right boundary.
            int m = (l+r)/2; // Calculate the middle element of the current search range.
            long sqr = (long) m*m; // Calculate the square of the middle element. Use 'long' to prevent potential integer overflow when squaring 'm'.
            if(sqr == num) return true; // If the square of the middle element is equal to the target number, return true.
            if(sqr < num) l = m+1; // If the square of the middle element is less than the target number, update the left boundary to search the right half.
            else r = m-1; // If the square of the middle element is greater than the target number, update the right boundary to search the left half.
        }
        return false; // If the loop completes without finding a perfect square, return false.
    }
}
```

- **`int l = 1;`**: Initializes the left pointer `l` to 1. This is the starting point of our search range. We start at 1 because we are given that `num` is a positive integer.
- **`int r = num;`**: Initializes the right pointer `r` to `num`.  This is the ending point of our search range. The square root of a number `num` can't be greater than `num` itself.
- **`while(l<=r)`**: This loop continues as long as the left pointer `l` is less than or equal to the right pointer `r`. This is the standard condition for binary search.
- **`int m = (l+r)/2;`**: Calculates the middle point `m` of the current search range. This is the potential square root that we will check.
- **`long sqr = (long) m*m;`**: Calculates the square of the middle element `m`.  Critically, we cast `m` to `long` *before* the multiplication.  This is to prevent integer overflow. If `m` is a large integer and `m*m` exceeds the maximum value of `int`, the result would wrap around, leading to incorrect comparisons and potentially an infinite loop. Casting to `long` ensures that the intermediate result `m*m` can be stored without overflow.
- **`if(sqr == num) return true;`**: If the square of the middle element `sqr` is equal to the target number `num`, we have found a perfect square, so we return `true`.
- **`if(sqr < num) l = m+1;`**: If the square of the middle element `sqr` is less than the target number `num`, it means the potential square root is too small, so we update the left pointer `l` to `m+1`.  We search in the right half of the current range.
- **`else r = m-1;`**: If the square of the middle element `sqr` is greater than the target number `num`, it means the potential square root is too large, so we update the right pointer `r` to `m-1`. We search in the left half of the current range.
- **`return false;`**: If the `while` loop completes without finding a perfect square, it means the target number `num` is not a perfect square, so we return `false`.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** O(log n), where n is the input number `num`. This is because the binary search algorithm halves the search space in each iteration.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1). The solution uses a constant amount of extra space for variables like `l`, `r`, `m`, and `sqr`.  The space used does not depend on the size of the input `num`.
