Okay, let's break down this Java code for the LeetCode problem "Find Latest Group of Size M."

## 1. Problem Understanding

The problem asks us to find the latest step in a sequence of operations where a group of consecutive '1's of size `m` exists.  We're given an array `arr` of length `n` representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`.  At each step `s`, we set `arr[s]` to '1' in a binary string of length `n` initially filled with '0's. We need to find the largest index `s` (step number) where there exists at least one contiguous group of '1's of size `m` in the binary string. If no such step exists, return -1.

## 2. Approach / Intuition

The core idea is to avoid repeatedly scanning the entire binary string after each step to check for groups of size `m`. Instead, we use an array `len` to keep track of the lengths of contiguous groups of '1's. The `len` array's indices represent positions in the binary string. `len[i]` stores the length of the contiguous group containing position `i`.

The crucial observation is that when we set a position `i` to '1', we can determine the length of the new contiguous group by looking at the lengths of the groups immediately to the left and right of `i`. We then merge these groups and update the `len` array accordingly.

A counter `c` keeps track of the number of groups of size `m`. This allows for a fast `O(1)` check if a group of size `m` exists after each step. If `c` is greater than 0, it means at least one group of size `m` exists.

This approach avoids the need for repeated linear scans, leading to a more efficient solution.  It leverages dynamic programming principles by storing and updating group lengths.

## 3. Data Structures and Algorithms

*   **`len` Array (int[]):**  This array is the heart of the solution.  `len[i]` stores the length of the contiguous group of '1's that includes position `i` in the conceptual binary string. Its size is `n+2` to avoid index out of bounds errors for edge cases when processing neighbors.
*   **`c` Variable (int):**  A counter to track the number of groups of size `m`.
*   **Iteration:** The code iterates through the input array `arr`, processing one element (step) at a time.
*   **Dynamic Programming (Implicit):**  The `len` array stores intermediate results (group lengths) that are updated as we process each step. We reuse previously computed lengths to determine the length of newly formed groups.

## 4. Code Walkthrough

```java
class Solution {
    public int findLatestStep(int[] arr, int m) {
        int n = arr.length;
        if (m == n) return n; // If m is equal to n, then the last step is when all the positions are set to 1
        int[] len = new int[n+2]; // Stores the length of the consecutive 1's sequence to which an index belongs
        int c = 0; // Count of the number of segments of size m
        int ans = -1; // Stores the latest step number where we found a segment of size m

        for(int s = 0 ; s<n ; s++) {
            int i = arr[s]; // Get the index to be set to 1 in the current step
            int l = len[i-1]; // Length of the segment to the left of index i
            int r = len[i+1]; // Length of the segment to the right of index i
            int t = l+r+1; // Total length of the combined segment (left + right + current index)

            len[i-l] = t; // Update the leftmost index of the combined segment with the new length
            len[i+r] = t; // Update the rightmost index of the combined segment with the new length
            len[i] = t; // Update the current index with the new length

            if(l == m) c--; // If the length of the left segment was m, decrement the count
            if(r == m) c--; // If the length of the right segment was m, decrement the count
            if(t == m) c++; // If the length of the combined segment is m, increment the count

            if(c>0) {
                ans = s+1; // If there is at least one segment of size m, update the answer with the current step number
            }
        }
        return ans; // Return the latest step number where we found a segment of size m
    }
}
```

*   **Initialization:**
    *   `n = arr.length;`:  Gets the length of the input array.
    *   `if (m == n) return n;`:  Handles the base case where `m` is equal to `n`. In this case, the entire array will be filled with 1s in the `n`-th step, and so the answer is `n`.
    *   `len = new int[n+2];`: Initializes the `len` array with a size of `n+2`.  The extra space is for boundary conditions, avoiding out-of-bounds access when checking `len[i-1]` and `len[i+1]`.
    *   `c = 0;`: Initializes the count of segments with length `m` to zero.
    *   `ans = -1;`: Initializes the answer to -1.

*   **Looping through Steps:**
    *   `for(int s = 0 ; s<n ; s++) { ... }`:  The main loop iterates through each step `s` of the process (each element of the `arr` array).
    *   `int i = arr[s];`:  `i` is the index that will be set to 1 in the binary string during step `s`.

*   **Calculating and Updating Group Lengths:**
    *   `int l = len[i-1];`:  `l` stores the length of the contiguous group immediately to the left of position `i`.
    *   `int r = len[i+1];`:  `r` stores the length of the contiguous group immediately to the right of position `i`.
    *   `int t = l+r+1;`:  `t` calculates the total length of the newly formed contiguous group after setting `arr[s]` to 1. It's the sum of the left group's length, the right group's length, and 1 (for the newly set '1' at position `i`).
    *   `len[i-l] = t;`:  Updates the leftmost position of the combined group with the new total length `t`. We use `i-l` because this is the leftmost end of the combined group.
    *   `len[i+r] = t;`:  Updates the rightmost position of the combined group with the new total length `t`. We use `i+r` because this is the rightmost end of the combined group.
    *   `len[i] = t;`: Updates the length of the current index i with length of the combined segment.

*   **Maintaining the Group Count (`c`)**
    *   `if(l == m) c--;`: If the left group's length was equal to `m` *before* merging, we decrement `c` because we've now merged that group into a larger one (it's no longer a group of size `m` by itself).
    *   `if(r == m) c--;`: Similarly, if the right group's length was equal to `m` *before* merging, we decrement `c`.
    *   `if(t == m) c++;`: If the total length of the new group is `m`, we increment `c`.

*   **Updating the Answer:**
    *   `if(c>0) { ans = s+1; }`: If, after processing step `s`, there is at least one group of size `m` (i.e., `c > 0`), we update `ans` with the current step number (`s + 1`).  We add 1 to `s` because the problem asks for the step number, which is 1-indexed.

*   **Return Value:**
    *   `return ans;`: Finally, the function returns the value of `ans`, which represents the latest step at which a group of size `m` existed.

## 5. Time and Space Complexity

*   **Time Complexity: O(n)**
    *   The code iterates through the `arr` array once, which takes O(n) time.
    *   All other operations inside the loop (array accesses, arithmetic operations, comparisons) take constant time, O(1).
    *   Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n).

*   **Space Complexity: O(n)**
    *   The `len` array has a size of `n + 2`, so it takes O(n) space.
    *   The other variables (`n`, `m`, `c`, `ans`, `i`, `l`, `r`, `t`, `s`) take constant space, O(1).
    *   Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(n).
