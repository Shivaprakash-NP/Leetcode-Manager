## LeetCode: Smallest Subarrays With Maximum Bitwise OR - Solution Explained

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the length of the smallest subarray, starting from each index `i`,  whose elements have a bitwise OR equal to the maximum possible bitwise OR achievable from any subarray starting at `i`.  In simpler terms, for each position in the input array, we need to find the smallest window to the right (inclusive) that contains all the bits set in the maximum possible OR value starting from that position.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution employs a clever bit manipulation technique to efficiently find the smallest subarray.  Instead of brute-forcing all possible subarrays, it iterates through the input array from right to left.  For each number, it tracks the rightmost index where each bit (0-31) is set within the already processed part of the array. This is done using the `map` array.  The crucial insight is that once a bit is set in the `map`, any subarray containing that bit needs to extend at least to the index where that bit was last seen. This allows us to efficiently calculate the minimum subarray length by checking the rightmost index of each set bit for every element. The algorithm leverages the fact that the bitwise OR operation is associative and commutative, meaning the order of elements doesn't affect the final OR value.

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * `ans[]`: An integer array to store the lengths of the smallest subarrays.
    * `map[]`: An integer array (size 32) to store the rightmost index of each bit (0-31). `map[j]` holds the rightmost index where the j-th bit is set.
* **Algorithms:**
    * **Iteration:** The main algorithm iterates through the input array from right to left.
    * **Bit Manipulation:**  The code uses bitwise AND (`&`), right shift (`>>`), and OR operations to efficiently manipulate bits.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **Initialization:**
    * `n`: Stores the length of the input array `nums`.
    * `ans[]`: Initialized to store the results.
    * `map[]`: Initialized with -1 indicating that no bit is set yet.

* **Iteration (Reverse):** The outer loop iterates from the last element (`n-1`) to the first element (0). This reverse iteration is crucial because it allows us to efficiently track the rightmost index of each set bit.

* **Inner Loop (Bit Processing):** The inner loop iterates through the bits (0 to 31) of the current number `nums[i]`.
    * `(tem & 1)`: Checks if the least significant bit is set.
    * `map[j] = i;`: If the bit is set, update `map[j]` to the current index `i`.
    * `tem = tem >> 1;`: Right-shift `tem` to check the next bit.
    * `r = Math.max(r, map[j]);`:  Finds the rightmost index (`r`) among all bits set.  This ensures the subarray extends to include all the bits.

* **Result Calculation:**
    * `ans[i] = r - i + 1;`: Calculates the length of the smallest subarray and stores it in `ans[i]`.

* **Return Value:** The function returns the `ans` array containing the lengths of the smallest subarrays for each starting index.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(N*K), where N is the length of the input array and K is the number of bits (32 in this case). The nested loops contribute to this complexity.  In practice, K is a constant, so it's effectively linear O(N).

* **Space Complexity:** O(K), where K is the number of bits. The `map` array dominates the space complexity.  Again, since K is a constant (32), the space complexity is considered O(1).


**In summary:** This solution cleverly uses bit manipulation and a right-to-left iteration to avoid the need for exploring all subarrays, resulting in an efficient algorithm with linear time complexity. The use of a fixed-size `map` keeps the space complexity constant.  The solution demonstrates a good understanding of bitwise operations and their applications in problem-solving.
