## LeetCode: Minimum Depth of Binary Tree - Solution Explained

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the minimum depth of a binary tree.  The minimum depth is the shortest path from the root node to any leaf node.  A leaf node is a node with no children.  If the tree is empty (root is null), the minimum depth is 0.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution employs a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach using recursion.  The core idea is to recursively explore the left and right subtrees, tracking the depth at each step.  Crucially, unlike finding the *maximum* depth, where we'd take the maximum of the left and right subtree depths, here we take the *minimum*. This is because we are looking for the shortest path to a leaf.  If either the left or right subtree is empty (depth 0), it means we've reached a leaf node through that side, and we should add 1 (for the current node) to the depth of the other subtree (or 0 + 1 if both are 0). Otherwise, we take the minimum depth of the left and right subtrees and add 1.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structure:** The primary data structure is the binary tree itself, represented using the `TreeNode` class.  No auxiliary data structures are explicitly used; the recursion manages the exploration of the tree implicitly through the call stack.
* **Algorithm:** Depth-First Search (DFS) using recursion.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **`TreeNode` class:** This is a standard definition for a node in a binary tree, containing an integer value (`val`) and pointers to its left and right children (`left` and `right`).

* **`dfs(TreeNode node)` function:** This is a recursive helper function that calculates the minimum depth.
    * **`if(node == null) return 0;`:** Base case: If the current node is null (we've reached the end of a branch), the depth is 0.
    * **`int l = dfs(node.left);` and `int r = dfs(node.right);`:** Recursively calculate the minimum depths of the left and right subtrees.
    * **`if(0 == l || 0 == r) return l+r+1;`:** This is the crucial part for finding the *minimum* depth. If either `l` or `r` is 0, it means we've found a leaf node on that side. We return the sum of the depths (`l` and `r`) plus 1 (to account for the current node). This handles cases where one branch might be shorter than the other.
    * **`return Math.min(l , r)+1;`:** If both left and right subtrees have non-zero depths, we return the minimum depth between them, plus 1 (for the current node).

* **`minDepth(TreeNode root)` function:** This function simply calls the `dfs` function with the root node as input, providing a clean interface for the user.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree.  In the worst case, we visit each node once during the DFS traversal.

* **Space Complexity:** O(H), where H is the height of the binary tree. This space is used by the call stack during the recursive calls. In the worst case (a skewed tree), H can be equal to N, resulting in O(N) space complexity. In the best case (a balanced tree), H is logâ‚‚(N), resulting in O(log N) space complexity.


**Improvements:**

While the provided code is functional, it could be slightly improved for readability by using a more explicit conditional instead of `if(0 == l || 0 == r)`:

```java
if (l == 0 || r == 0) return l + r + 1;
```

This minor change doesn't affect the time or space complexity but improves code clarity.  Furthermore, using an iterative approach with a queue would eliminate the risk of stack overflow errors for extremely deep trees, though it would slightly increase space complexity due to the queue storage.
