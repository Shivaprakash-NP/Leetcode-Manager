## Two Sum IV - Input is a BST: Detailed Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks whether there exist two nodes in a given Binary Search Tree (BST) whose values add up to a specific target value, `k`.  We need to determine if such a pair exists and return `true` if it does, otherwise `false`.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

This solution uses a two-pointer approach, efficiently traversing the BST in an inorder (ascending) and reverse inorder (descending) fashion simultaneously.  Instead of creating sorted arrays (which would require extra space), it leverages the inherent sorted nature of a BST's inorder traversal.

The algorithm maintains two stacks, `st_N` (for next/inorder traversal) and `st_P` (for previous/reverse inorder traversal).  `next()` retrieves the next smallest element from the BST using `st_N`, while `pre()` retrieves the next largest element using `st_P`.  By moving the pointers towards the middle, we efficiently check all possible pairs.  This approach avoids the need to explicitly sort the BST nodes.  It's chosen because it offers a better time complexity than methods involving full BST traversal and searching.

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * `TreeNode`:  Represents a node in the BST.
    * `Stack<TreeNode>`: Two stacks (`st_N` and `st_P`) are used to store nodes during the inorder and reverse inorder traversals.  Stacks provide LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) functionality, ideal for iterative traversal.
* **Algorithms:**
    * **Inorder Traversal:**  A standard BST traversal method that visits nodes in ascending order. Used implicitly through `next()` and `pushLeft()`.
    * **Reverse Inorder Traversal:** A BST traversal visiting nodes in descending order. Used implicitly through `pre()` and `pushRight()`.
    * **Two-Pointer Approach:** Two pointers (`l` and `r`) move from the smallest and largest elements, respectively, towards the middle, checking for the target sum.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **`TreeNode` Class:** This is a standard definition for a node in a binary tree, provided by LeetCode.

* **`pushLeft(TreeNode node)` and `pushRight(TreeNode node)`:** These functions push all nodes on the left subtree (for `pushLeft`) or right subtree (for `pushRight`) onto their respective stacks.  This efficiently prepares the stacks for inorder and reverse inorder traversals.  They use iterative approaches to push nodes onto the stacks, ensuring all left (or right) children are pushed before their parents.

* **`next()` and `pre()`:** These functions pop the top node from their respective stacks, retrieving the next smallest (`next()`) or next largest (`pre()`) node's value.  They then push the right subtree of the popped node onto `st_N` (for `next()`) or the left subtree of the popped node onto `st_P` (for `pre()`), ensuring correct traversal continuation.

* **`findTarget(TreeNode root, int k)`:** This is the main function.
    * It initializes the stacks by pushing all leftmost nodes onto `st_N` and all rightmost nodes onto `st_P`.
    * It retrieves the initial smallest (`l`) and largest (`r`) values using `next()` and `pre()`.
    * It enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `l` and `r` point to different nodes.
    * Inside the loop, it checks if `l + r == k`. If true, it returns `true`.
    * If `l + r < k`, it increments `l` by calling `next()`.
    * If `l + r > k`, it decrements `r` by calling `pre()`.
    * If the loop completes without finding a pair, it returns `false`.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the BST.  In the worst case (a skewed tree), both stacks will contain all N nodes, but each node is visited at most once. The while loop iterates at most N times.

* **Space Complexity:** O(H), where H is the height of the BST.  In the worst case (a skewed tree), the height can be N. The space complexity is dominated by the stacks which can store at most H nodes (in a balanced tree H would be logN).  In a balanced BST, this would be O(log N).


In summary, this solution provides an efficient and elegant way to solve the "Two Sum IV - Input is a BST" problem by cleverly using inorder and reverse inorder traversals and a two-pointer approach, resulting in a linear time complexity.  The space complexity is dependent on the height of the BST,  becoming particularly efficient for balanced trees.
