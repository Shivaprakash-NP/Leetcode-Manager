## Minimum Number of Operations to Sort a Binary Tree by Level - LeetCode Solution Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the minimum number of swaps required to sort the nodes at each level of a binary tree in ascending order.  We consider only the values of the nodes at each level, not their positions within the tree.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution uses a level-order traversal to process each level of the binary tree independently. For each level, it extracts the node values into a list. Then, it uses a separate function `find()` to calculate the minimum swaps needed to sort that list. The total number of swaps across all levels is the final answer.

The `find()` function uses a cycle detection algorithm to efficiently determine the minimum swaps.  It works by associating each element with its original index and then sorting the elements. The number of cycles detected in the sorted list's index permutation determines the number of swaps needed. This is because each cycle can be sorted with one fewer swaps than its length (by rotating it).

This approach is efficient because it processes each level independently, avoiding unnecessary comparisons between nodes on different levels.  The cycle detection method in `find()` is also efficient for finding the minimum swaps in an array.

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * `Queue<TreeNode>`:  A queue is used for level-order traversal of the binary tree.
    * `List<Integer>`:  A list stores the node values at each level.
    * `int[][]`: A 2D array is used in `find()` to store node values and their original indices.
    * `boolean[]`: A boolean array `visited` tracks visited nodes during cycle detection in `find()`.
* **Algorithms:**
    * **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Used for level-order traversal of the binary tree.
    * **Counting Sort (implicitly):** The `Arrays.sort` function uses a sorting algorithm (likely a variation of merge sort or quicksort in Java's implementation)  to sort the node values along with their indices.
    * **Cycle Detection:** The `find()` function uses a cycle detection algorithm to count the number of cycles in the permutation of indices after sorting.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **`find(List<Integer> nums)`:**
    * Creates a 2D array `arr` to store the values and original indices of elements in `nums`.
    * Sorts `arr` based on the values (first element of each subarray).
    * Initializes a `visited` array to track visited indices during cycle detection.
    * Iterates through the sorted array. If an element is not visited and its index is not in its correct sorted position, it performs cycle detection:
        * It counts the elements in the cycle (`cycleSize`).
        * It adds `cycleSize - 1` to the total number of swaps.
    * Returns the total number of swaps.

* **`minimumOperations(TreeNode root)`:**
    * Performs a level-order traversal using a queue.
    * For each level, it collects the node values in a list `val`.
    * Calls `find()` to calculate the swaps needed for the current level and adds it to the total `ans`.
    * Returns the total number of swaps across all levels.

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **`find(List<Integer> nums)`:**
    * **Time Complexity:** O(N log N) due to sorting, plus O(N) for cycle detection. The overall time complexity is O(N log N).
    * **Space Complexity:** O(N) to store the `arr` and `visited` arrays.

* **`minimumOperations(TreeNode root)`:**
    * **Time Complexity:** O(N log N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.  This is because the `find()` function is called for each level, and in the worst case (a complete binary tree), the sum of the sizes of levels is still linear in N.  The level-order traversal itself takes O(N) time.
    * **Space Complexity:** O(N) in the worst case due to the queue used in level-order traversal and the space used by `find()`.  The space used by the queue is proportional to the maximum width of the tree which can be N in the worst case (a complete binary tree).


In summary, the solution efficiently solves the problem by combining level-order traversal with an optimized cycle detection algorithm for calculating the minimum number of swaps needed to sort each level. The overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step within `find()`.
