## LeetCode: Binary Search Tree Iterator - Detailed Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to design an iterator for a Binary Search Tree (BST).  This iterator should allow us to traverse the BST in *inorder* fashion (left subtree, node, right subtree) using `next()` to get the next smallest element and `hasNext()` to check if there are more elements.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The most efficient way to implement an inorder traversal iterator for a BST is using a stack.  We avoid the overhead of recursion by explicitly managing the traversal order using a stack.  The core idea is to pre-populate the stack with all the leftmost nodes of the tree and their ancestors.  Then, whenever `next()` is called, we pop the top element (which is the smallest remaining element), and if it has a right subtree, we push all the leftmost nodes of that right subtree onto the stack. This ensures that the next smallest element is always at the top of the stack.  This approach is chosen because it provides an iterative solution with a time complexity superior to a recursive approach for large trees, avoiding potential stack overflow issues.

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structure:**  A `Stack` is used to store `TreeNode` objects.  The stack acts as our implicit recursion, maintaining the inorder traversal order.
* **Algorithm:**  The algorithm employs a depth-first search (DFS) strategy using an iterative approach.  We effectively perform an inorder traversal using a stack.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **`BSTIterator(TreeNode root)`:** The constructor initializes the stack. It calls `pushAllLeft(root)` to push all the leftmost nodes of the root's subtree onto the stack.  This sets up the iterator to return the smallest element first.

* **`pushAllLeft(TreeNode node)`:** This helper function takes a node as input and pushes all its left descendants onto the stack. It repeatedly pushes the current node and then moves to its left child until it reaches a `null` node (end of the left subtree).

* **`next()`:**  This function pops the top element from the stack (the smallest remaining element), returns its value, and then checks if the popped node has a right child. If it does, it calls `pushAllLeft` on the right child to add all the leftmost nodes of the right subtree to the stack, preparing for the next `next()` call.

* **`hasNext()`:** This function simply checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is not empty, it means there are more elements to be iterated, and it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:**
    * `next()`:  O(h) in the worst case, where h is the height of the tree (skewed tree). In a balanced tree, it would be O(log n).  Pushing all left nodes takes O(h) in the worst case, and popping takes O(1).
    * `hasNext()`: O(1) â€“ checking stack emptiness is constant time.
    * `BSTIterator(TreeNode root)`: O(h) or O(n) in the worst case (skewed tree), where h is the height and n is the number of nodes. In a balanced tree, it's O(log n).

* **Space Complexity:** O(h) or O(n) in the worst case (skewed tree), where h is the height and n is the number of nodes. This is because the stack can hold at most h nodes (height of the tree) in a balanced tree or n nodes in a skewed tree.  For a balanced tree, this is O(log n).


In summary, this iterative solution using a stack provides an efficient way to implement an inorder traversal iterator for a BST, avoiding the potential stack overflow issues of a recursive approach while maintaining good time complexity for balanced trees.  The space complexity is directly related to the height of the tree.
