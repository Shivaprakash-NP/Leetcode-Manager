# LeetCode: Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II - Solution Explained

## 1. Problem Understanding

The problem "Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II" asks us to modify a given binary tree.  Each node in the tree has a `next` pointer, initially `null`. The goal is to populate these `next` pointers such that for every node, its `next` pointer points to the next node at the same level in the tree (from left to right).  Unlike the "Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node I" problem, this version handles a *general* binary tree, meaning nodes can have zero, one, or two children.


## 2. Approach / Intuition

This solution employs a Level Order Traversal (Breadth-First Search) using a queue.  Level order traversal ensures we process nodes level by level.  We iterate through each level, and for each node, we set its `next` pointer to the next node in the queue (unless it's the last node on the level). This approach is chosen because it directly and efficiently connects nodes at the same level.  Other approaches like recursion are less intuitive and might require more complex bookkeeping to manage level information.


## 3. Data Structures and Algorithms

* **Data Structures:**  A `Queue` (specifically `LinkedList` in Java) is used to implement the level order traversal. This queue stores nodes to be processed.

* **Algorithms:** Level Order Traversal (BFS) is the core algorithm used.


## 4. Code Walkthrough

```java
/* ... Node class definition ... */

class Solution {
    public Node connect(Node root) {
        if(root == null) return root; // Handle empty tree case
        Queue<Node> q = new LinkedList<>();
        q.offer(root); // Add the root to the queue to start traversal

        while(!q.isEmpty()) { // Continue until the queue is empty (all levels processed)
            int n = q.size(); // Number of nodes at the current level
            for(int i = 0 ; i < n ; i++) {
                Node node = q.poll(); // Get the next node from the queue
                node.next = (i == n-1)?null:q.peek(); //Set next pointer; null if last node on the level, otherwise to the next node in the queue
                if(node.left != null) q.offer(node.left); // Add left child to the queue
                if(node.right != null) q.offer(node.right); // Add right child to the queue
            }
        }

        return root; // Return the root of the modified tree
    }
}
```

The code systematically processes each level:

1. **Base Case:** Handles the case of an empty tree.
2. **Queue Initialization:** A queue `q` is created and initialized with the root node.
3. **Level Iteration:** The `while` loop iterates through each level of the tree. `q.size()` gets the number of nodes at the current level.
4. **Node Processing:** The `for` loop processes each node at the current level. `q.poll()` removes and returns the next node.
5. **`next` Pointer Assignment:** `node.next` is set. The ternary operator efficiently handles the last node of the level.
6. **Child Addition:**  The left and right children of the current node are added to the queue for processing in the next iteration.


## 5. Time and Space Complexity

* **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited and processed exactly once.

* **Space Complexity:** O(W), where W is the maximum width (maximum number of nodes at any level) of the tree.  In the worst-case scenario (a complete binary tree), W can be proportional to N, resulting in O(N) space complexity.  However, for trees with smaller widths at each level, the space complexity is less than O(N).  The queue stores nodes from one level at a time.
