## Minimum Score After Removals on a Tree: Detailed Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the minimum difference between the maximum and minimum XOR sums of three disjoint subsets of nodes in a tree.  We are given an array `nums` representing values associated with nodes and an adjacency matrix `edges` describing the tree structure.  By removing edges, we partition the tree into three subtrees, and we need to find the minimum score (max XOR - min XOR) among all possible partitions.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution employs a depth-first search (DFS) to efficiently calculate XOR sums of subtrees.  The core idea is as follows:

* **Preprocessing with DFS:** We perform a DFS to compute the XOR sum of all nodes in the subtree rooted at each node (`xor` array).  Simultaneously, we track which nodes belong to each subtree using a set (`set` array). This allows us to quickly determine the XOR sum of any subtree.

* **Iterating through Partitions:**  The code then iterates through all possible pairs of nodes (i, j) as potential removal points. This implicitly defines the three subtrees.

* **Calculating XOR Sums of Subtrees:**  Based on whether nodes `i` and `j` are in the same subtree, the code cleverly calculates the XOR sums of the three resulting subtrees (`x1`, `x2`, `x3`).

* **Finding the Minimum Score:** For each partition, it calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum XOR sums and updates the `res` variable to track the minimum score found so far.

This approach is chosen because it efficiently calculates subtree XOR sums once (during DFS) and avoids redundant calculations. The brute-force approach of checking all possible partitions without pre-computation would be significantly slower.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * `int[] xor`:  Stores the XOR sum of the subtree rooted at each node.
    * `ArrayList<Integer>[] adj`: Adjacency list representing the tree.
    * `HashSet<Integer>[] set`:  Stores the set of nodes in the subtree rooted at each node.
    * `int[][] edges`: Adjacency matrix representing the tree edges.

* **Algorithms:**
    * Depth-First Search (DFS): Used to traverse the tree and calculate subtree XOR sums and node sets.
    * Brute-force search (partially):  Iterates through all pairs of nodes to consider all possible partitions (removal of two edges).


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **`dfs(par, chi, nums)`:** This recursive DFS function calculates the XOR sum of the subtree rooted at node `chi` (child node), given its parent `par`. It recursively calculates XOR sums for child nodes, updates the `xor` array, and adds nodes to the corresponding `set`.

* **`calc(a, b, c)`:** This helper function calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum of three integers (XOR sums).

* **`minimumScore(nums, edges)`:** This is the main function.
    * It initializes the `xor`, `adj`, and `set` arrays.
    * It constructs the adjacency list from the `edges` array.
    * It performs DFS to populate the `xor` and `set` arrays.
    * It iterates through all pairs of nodes (i, j), calculating the XOR sums of the three resulting subtrees (`x1`, `x2`, `x3`).  The logic handles different cases depending on the relationship between nodes `i` and `j` and their subtrees.
    * It updates `res` to track the minimum score.
    * It returns the minimum score `res`.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(N^2), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. The DFS takes O(N) time. The nested loop iterating through all pairs of nodes takes O(N^2) time.  The remaining operations within the loops are O(1) or O(log N) in the worst case for HashSet operations (which can be considered approximately O(1) on average).

* **Space Complexity:** O(N), primarily due to the `xor`, `adj`, and `set` arrays, all of which store information for each node. The recursive call stack during DFS also contributes to the space complexity but is at most O(N) in the worst case (a completely skewed tree).


In summary, the solution efficiently solves the problem by using DFS to pre-compute key information, thus reducing the time complexity compared to a purely brute-force approach that would explore all possible partitions without pre-computation.  The space used is linear with respect to the number of nodes.
