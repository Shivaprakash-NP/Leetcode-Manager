## LeetCode: Partition Equal Subset Sum - Solution Explained

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The "Partition Equal Subset Sum" problem asks whether a given array of non-negative integers can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.  In essence, we need to determine if it's possible to divide the array into two halves with the same sum.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution employs dynamic programming (DP) to efficiently solve this problem.  The core idea is to build a boolean table ( `dp` array) where `dp[i][j]` indicates whether a sum `j` can be achieved using the first `i` elements of the input array `nums`.

We iterate through the array. For each element, we have two choices: either include it in the current subset or not.

* **Not Include:**  If we don't include the current element (`nums[i]`), the possibility of achieving sum `j` remains the same as it was with the previous `i-1` elements; this is represented by `dp[i-1][j]`.

* **Include:** If we include the current element, we need to check if the remaining sum (`j - nums[i]`) could be achieved using the previous `i-1` elements; this is represented by `dp[i-1][j - nums[i]]`.

If either of these possibilities is true, then we can achieve sum `j` using the first `i` elements, so we set `dp[i][j]` to `true`.

This approach is chosen because it systematically explores all possible combinations of including or excluding elements, avoiding redundant calculations thanks to DP's memoization.  A brute-force approach would be exponentially slower.

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:** A 2D boolean array (`dp`) is used for dynamic programming.  This array stores the results of subproblems to avoid recalculation.

* **Algorithms:** The core algorithm is dynamic programming.  We use a bottom-up approach, filling the `dp` array iteratively.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **Lines 3-5:** The code calculates the total sum of the input array `nums`.  If the sum is odd, it's impossible to partition it into two equal subsets, so it immediately returns `false`.

* **Line 6:** `target` is calculated as half of the total sum â€“ this is the target sum we need to achieve for one subset.

* **Line 7:** A 2D boolean array `dp` of size `(n+1) x (target+1)` is initialized.  `dp[i][j]` will be `true` if a sum `j` is achievable using the first `i` elements.

* **Line 9:** The first column of `dp` is set to `true`. This is because a sum of 0 is always achievable (by not selecting any elements).

* **Line 11:** If the first element is less than or equal to the target sum it's set to true in the DP table.

* **Lines 13-17:** This is the core dynamic programming loop. It iterates through each element (`i`) and each possible target sum (`tar`) from 1 to `target`.  It considers both the possibility of including (`take`) and not including (`nottake`) the current element and updates `dp[i][tar]` accordingly using a boolean OR operation.

* **Line 19:** Finally, `dp[n-1][target]` indicates whether the target sum (`target`) could be achieved using all `n` elements.  This value is returned as the result.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(n*target), where `n` is the length of the input array and `target` is half of the total sum. The nested loops iterate through the `dp` array.

* **Space Complexity:** O(n*target). The space is dominated by the `dp` array.

**In summary:** The provided Java code efficiently solves the "Partition Equal Subset Sum" problem using dynamic programming.  Its time and space complexity are directly proportional to the size of the input and the target sum, making it a reasonably efficient solution for moderately sized inputs.  However, for extremely large inputs where `target` is very large, the space complexity could become a limiting factor.  Optimization techniques like using bit manipulation could improve the space complexity but usually comes with some time complexity overhead.
