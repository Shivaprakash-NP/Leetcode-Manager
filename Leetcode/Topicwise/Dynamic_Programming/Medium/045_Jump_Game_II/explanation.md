# LeetCode: Jump Game II - Detailed Solution Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The "Jump Game II" problem asks: Given an array of non-negative integers `nums`, where each element represents the maximum jump length from that position, find the minimum number of jumps required to reach the last index (index `nums.length - 1`) from the first index (index 0).  If it's impossible to reach the last index, return -1 (though this code implicitly assumes it's always reachable).


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

This solution uses a **greedy approach** to solve the problem efficiently.  Instead of exploring all possible jump paths (which would be exponential), it iteratively finds the furthest reachable index in each jump.  The core idea is to maintain three pointers:

* `l`: The left boundary of the current reachable range.
* `r`: The right boundary of the current reachable range.
* `far`: The furthest index reachable from within the current range (`[l, r]`).

The algorithm iteratively expands the reachable range until the right boundary (`r`) reaches or surpasses the last index of the array.  The number of jumps is incremented in each iteration.

This approach is chosen because it avoids unnecessary exploration of paths.  By always jumping to the furthest possible position within each range, we guarantee finding the minimum number of jumps.  A brute-force approach using backtracking or dynamic programming would be significantly less efficient.

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:** The primary data structure used is an array (`nums`) to represent the jump lengths.
* **Algorithms:** The core algorithm is a greedy approach, combined with iterative range expansion.  It doesn't use any sophisticated graph algorithms or dynamic programming techniques, keeping it simple and efficient.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

```java
class Solution {
    public int jump(int[] nums) {
        int j = 0;          // Counter for the number of jumps.
        int l = 0;          // Left boundary of the reachable range.
        int r = 0;          // Right boundary of the reachable range.
        int far = 0;        // Furthest reachable index from the current range.

        while(r < nums.length-1) { // Continue until the last index is reached or surpassed.

            for(int i = l ; i<=r ; i++) // Iterate through the current reachable range.
                far = Math.max(far , i+nums[i]); // Find the furthest reachable index.

            l = r+1;       // Update the left boundary to the next range's start.
            r = far;        // Update the right boundary to the furthest reachable index.
            j++;           // Increment the jump count.
        }
        return j;       // Return the total number of jumps.
    }
}
```

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the length of the `nums` array.  The outer `while` loop iterates a number of times proportional to the number of jumps needed (which is at most N). The inner `for` loop iterates through a portion of the array in each iteration of the outer loop.  In the worst case, the inner loop might iterate through the entire array once, resulting in a linear time complexity.

* **Space Complexity:** O(1). The solution uses a constant amount of extra space to store the variables `j`, `l`, `r`, and `far`, regardless of the input array size.  Therefore, the space complexity is constant.


**In summary:** This Java code provides an efficient and concise solution to the Jump Game II problem using a greedy approach.  Its linear time complexity and constant space complexity make it a suitable solution for large input arrays.  The code is well-structured and easy to understand, making it a good example of a clean and efficient LeetCode solution.
