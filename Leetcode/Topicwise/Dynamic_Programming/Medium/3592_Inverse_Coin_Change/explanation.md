## LeetCode: Inverse Coin Change Problem Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The "Inverse Coin Change" problem (as inferred from the code) presents us with an array `numWays`.  Each element `numWays[i]` represents the number of ways to make change for a value `i+1` using a set of coins.  The goal is to find the denominations of these coins.  The code implicitly assumes that there's only one unique set of coins that can generate the given `numWays` array. If multiple sets of coins could produce the same `numWays`, the code might not provide a correct solution.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution employs a greedy approach combined with dynamic programming principles (though not explicitly in a traditional DP manner).  It iteratively identifies the smallest coin denomination.  It does so by searching for the first `1` in the `numWays` array, indicating that there's only one way to make change for that value â€“ thus representing a coin's face value. Once identified, this coin's value is then used to update the `numWays` array: it subtracts the number of ways to create larger values using this coin denomination, effectively removing its influence from higher value counts. This process repeats until no more `1`s are found in the `numWays` array, meaning all coins have been identified. If at the end there are any non-zero values in `numWays` that are not zero, it indicates that the input is inconsistent and that it is impossible to form the specified number of ways to make change given a set of coins.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * `List<Integer>`:  Used to represent `numWays` (converted from an array) and `ans` (the list of coin denominations).  Lists are chosen for ease of modification (inserting and removing elements).
* **Algorithms:**
    * **Greedy Algorithm:** The algorithm greedily selects the smallest coin denomination at each step.
    * **Linear Search:** `way.indexOf(1)` performs a linear search to find the smallest coin.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **Lines 3-4:** The input array `numWays` is converted into a `List<Integer>` called `way` and an empty list `ans` is initialized to store the coin denominations.
* **Line 6:** `n` stores the length of the `numWays` array.
* **Lines 7-13 (while loop):** This loop iterates until no more `1`s are found in the `way` list.
    * **Line 8:** `ind` finds the index of the first `1` in `way`, representing the next smallest coin denomination. If no 1 is found, it breaks.
    * **Line 9:** `ind + 1` (the actual coin value) is added to the `ans` list.
    * **Lines 11-12:** This loop updates `way` by subtracting the contribution of the found coin from higher denominations. It essentially removes the influence of this coin on counts for larger values.
    * **Line 13:** The entry at index `ind` (the found coin) in `way` is set to 0.
* **Lines 15-17:**  This loop checks if any other values in `way` (except the first) are non-zero. If any are found, it means the input is inconsistent, and an empty list is returned.
* **Line 19:** The `ans` list (containing the coin denominations) is returned.

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(n^2). The outer `while` loop iterates at most `n` times (where `n` is the length of `numWays`). The inner `for` loop also iterates up to `n` times in the worst case.  The `indexOf` operation is O(n) in the worst case. Therefore, the overall time complexity is dominated by the nested loops, resulting in O(n^2).

* **Space Complexity:** O(n). The space is primarily used to store the `way` list and `ans` list, both of which are of size O(n).  Additional space used for variables is constant.  Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(n).


**Potential Improvements and Limitations:**

The code's efficiency could be improved by replacing the linear search (`indexOf`) with a more efficient data structure (e.g., a min-heap) to find the minimum value in each iteration. This would reduce the time complexity to O(n log n). The code only supports positive integer coin values and does not check for invalid inputs (like negative values in `numWays`).  Furthermore, it assumes a unique solution exists; handling cases with multiple solutions or no solutions would require a different approach.
