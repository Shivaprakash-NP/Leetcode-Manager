## Longest Unequal Adjacent Groups Subsequence I - Explained

Here's a detailed explanation of the Java code provided for the "Longest Unequal Adjacent Groups Subsequence I" LeetCode problem.

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to construct the longest possible subsequence from an array of strings (`words`) such that no two adjacent strings in the subsequence have the same group ID (specified by the `groups` array). We are given two arrays: `words` which contains the strings, and `groups` which contains the corresponding group ID for each word.  We need to return a `List<String>` representing the longest subsequence satisfying this "unequal adjacent groups" constraint.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is to iterate through the `words` and `groups` arrays, greedily selecting words that satisfy the condition of having a different group ID than the last selected word. We maintain the group ID of the last added word, and if the current word's group ID is different, we add the current word to our result subsequence and update the last group ID. This is a greedy approach because, at each step, we're making the locally optimal choice (adding the word if it doesn't violate the condition), which leads to a globally optimal solution (the longest possible subsequence).

Why this approach works: The problem statement guarantees that at least one such subsequence exists.  Because of this, simply picking any word that is valid will eventually lead to a complete, valid subsequence. Choosing greedily means we select any valid word when we encounter it, guaranteeing that we are building the *longest* such subsequence because we never skip a valid word.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **`ArrayList<String>`:** Used to store the resulting subsequence of words. `ArrayList` is chosen due to its dynamic resizing capability, making it suitable for building a subsequence without knowing its size beforehand.
*   **Greedy Algorithm:** The core logic relies on a greedy approach of picking the first valid word that has a different group than the previously selected word.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> getLongestSubsequence(String[] words, int[] groups) {
        ArrayList<String> val = new ArrayList<>(); // Initialize an ArrayList to store the resulting subsequence.
        int last = groups[0]; // Initialize 'last' with the group ID of the first word. This tracks the group ID of the last added word.
        val.add(words[0]); // Add the first word to the subsequence as the base case.
        for(int i = 1 ; i < groups.length ; i++) { // Iterate through the remaining words and groups, starting from the second element.
            if(last!=groups[i]) { // Check if the current word's group ID is different from the last added word's group ID.
                val.add(words[i]); // If the group IDs are different, add the current word to the subsequence.
                last = groups[i]; // Update 'last' to the current word's group ID.
            }
        }
        return val; // Return the resulting subsequence.
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   `ArrayList<String> val = new ArrayList<>();`: Creates an empty `ArrayList` called `val` to hold the strings that will form the longest subsequence.
    *   `int last = groups[0];`: Initializes an integer variable `last` with the group ID of the *first* word. This `last` variable is crucial for comparing the group ID of the current word with the group ID of the last word added to the subsequence.
    *   `val.add(words[0]);`: The first word is always added to the subsequence since there's no previous word to compare its group ID with.

2.  **Iteration:**
    *   `for(int i = 1 ; i < groups.length ; i++)`: The loop iterates from the *second* element (index 1) of the `groups` array to the end. This is because we've already handled the first element in the initialization step.
    *   `if(last != groups[i])`: Inside the loop, this `if` statement checks if the group ID of the current word (`groups[i]`) is different from the group ID of the last word added to the subsequence (`last`).
    *   `val.add(words[i]);`: If the group IDs are different (the condition in the `if` statement is true), the current word (`words[i]`) is added to the `val` list (the subsequence).
    *   `last = groups[i];`: After adding the current word, the `last` variable is updated to the group ID of the current word (`groups[i]`) so that the next iteration can compare against the correct group ID.

3.  **Return:**
    *   `return val;`: Finally, the method returns the `val` list, which now contains the longest subsequence of words that satisfy the condition that no two adjacent words have the same group ID.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the `groups` (and `words`) array. The code iterates through the array once. The operations inside the loop (comparison and adding to the `ArrayList`) take constant time.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(n) in the worst case, where n is the length of the `groups` array. This is because, in the worst-case scenario (where all adjacent group IDs are different), the `val` list might store all n words. In the best case (all group IDs are the same except the first one), the space complexity would be O(1) since `val` would only contain one element.  However, when analyzing space complexity, we generally consider the worst-case scenario.
