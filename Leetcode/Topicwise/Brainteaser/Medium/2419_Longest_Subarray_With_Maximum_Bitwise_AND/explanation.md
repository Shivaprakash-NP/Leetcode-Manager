## Longest Subarray With Maximum Bitwise AND

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to find the length of the longest contiguous subarray within a given array `nums` such that the bitwise AND of all elements in that subarray is equal to the maximum value present in the entire array `nums`. Since the bitwise AND of a number with itself is the number itself, this effectively means we need to find the longest subarray containing only the maximum value present in `nums`.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The intuition behind the solution is based on the understanding that for the bitwise AND of a subarray to equal the maximum value in the array, *all* elements in that subarray *must* be equal to the maximum value.  If even a single element is smaller than the maximum, the bitwise AND will also be smaller.

Therefore, the approach involves the following steps:

1.  **Find the Maximum Value:**  Iterate through the array to determine the maximum element.
2.  **Count Consecutive Maximum Values:** Iterate again through the array, counting the consecutive occurrences of the maximum value.
3.  **Track the Longest Subarray:** Keep track of the longest consecutive subarray found so far.  Whenever we encounter an element that is *not* equal to the maximum, we update the `ans` with the current count `c` (if it is greater than the current `ans`) and reset the count `c` to 0.
4.  **Handle the End Case:** After the loop, we must update the `ans` one last time, in case the longest subarray extends to the end of the input `nums`.

This approach is chosen because it's a straightforward and efficient way to identify consecutive occurrences of a specific value within an array.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:**  We primarily use primitive data types: `int` to store the maximum value, the current count, and the answer. No complex data structures like arrays or linked lists are required beyond the input array `nums`.
*   **Algorithms:** The core algorithm is a simple linear scan (iteration) through the array.  We use `Math.max()` for finding the maximum value and for tracking the longest subarray.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestSubarray(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for(int v : nums) max = Math.max(max , v);

        int c = 0;
        int ans = 0;

        for(int v : nums) {
            if(v == max) c++;
            else {
                ans = Math.max(ans, c);
                c = 0;
            }
        }
        
        ans = Math.max(ans, c);

        return ans;
    }
}
```

*   **`int n = nums.length;`**: Stores the length of the input array `nums`. This is not explicitly used, but good practice to have.
*   **`int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;`**: Initializes `max` to the smallest possible integer value. This ensures that any value in `nums` will be greater than the initial `max`.
*   **`for(int v : nums) max = Math.max(max , v);`**:  A loop that iterates through each element `v` in the array `nums`.  It updates `max` with the largest value encountered so far using `Math.max()`. After this loop, `max` holds the maximum value in `nums`.
*   **`int c = 0;`**: Initializes `c` to 0.  This variable will count the length of the current consecutive subarray of maximum values.
*   **`int ans = 0;`**: Initializes `ans` to 0.  This variable will store the length of the longest consecutive subarray of maximum values found so far.
*   **`for(int v : nums) { ... }`**: A second loop that iterates through each element `v` in the array `nums`. This loop is the core of the solution.
    *   **`if(v == max) c++;`**: If the current element `v` is equal to the maximum value `max`, increment the counter `c`. This means we are extending the current consecutive subarray of maximum values.
    *   **`else { ans = Math.max(ans, c); c = 0; }`**: If the current element `v` is *not* equal to the maximum value `max`, it means the current consecutive subarray has ended.  We update `ans` to be the maximum of the current `ans` and the current count `c` (the length of the just-ended subarray).  Then, we reset the counter `c` to 0 to start counting a new potential subarray.
*   **`ans = Math.max(ans, c);`**: After the second loop completes, there is a possibility that the longest subarray extends to the end of the input. Therefore, we need to update `ans` one last time to consider the final consecutive subarray.
*   **`return ans;`**: Returns the value of `ans`, which now holds the length of the longest subarray where all elements are equal to the maximum value of the original array.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity: O(n)**

    The solution iterates through the array `nums` twice, once to find the maximum value and once to find the longest subarray.  Each iteration takes O(n) time, where n is the length of the array.  Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n) + O(n) = O(n).

*   **Space Complexity: O(1)**

    The solution uses only a few integer variables (`n`, `max`, `c`, `ans`) to store intermediate values.  The space used does not depend on the size of the input array `nums`. Therefore, the space complexity is O(1), which is constant space.
