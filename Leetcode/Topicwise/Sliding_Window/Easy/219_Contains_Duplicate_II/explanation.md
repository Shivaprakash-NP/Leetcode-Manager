## Contains Duplicate II: Detailed Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The "Contains Duplicate II" problem asks us to determine if there are any two distinct indices `i` and `j` in a given array `nums` such that `nums[i] == nums[j]` (the values at these indices are equal) and the absolute difference between `i` and `j` is at most `k` (i.e., `|i - j| <= k`).  In simpler terms, we need to check if there are any duplicate numbers within a distance of `k` from each other in the array.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is to use a sliding window approach combined with a hash set.

*   **Sliding Window:** We maintain a "window" of size `k+1` (at most) as we iterate through the array. This window represents the range of indices we are currently considering for potential nearby duplicates.
*   **Hash Set:** We use a hash set to efficiently keep track of the elements within the current window.  Hash sets allow us to quickly check if an element already exists in the set (i.e., if we've seen it within the window).

The algorithm's logic is as follows:

1.  Iterate through the array `nums`.
2.  For each element `nums[i]`, check if it already exists in the hash set `val`.
    *   If it exists, it means we have found a duplicate within the current window (distance `k` or less), so we return `true`.
3.  If `nums[i]` is not in the hash set, add it to the set.
4.  After adding the current element, we need to maintain the window size. If the current index `i` is greater than or equal to `k`, it means the element `nums[i-k]` is no longer within the window. We remove it from the hash set.
5.  If we iterate through the entire array without finding any duplicates within the specified distance `k`, we return `false`.

The reason this approach is effective is that it efficiently checks for duplicates within the sliding window. The hash set provides O(1) average time complexity for `contains` and `add` operations, making the overall algorithm relatively fast.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structure:** `HashSet`
*   **Algorithm:** Sliding Window

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean containsNearbyDuplicate(int[] nums, int k) {
        HashSet<Integer> val = new HashSet<>(); // Create a HashSet to store elements within the sliding window

        for(int i = 0 ; i<nums.length ; i++) // Iterate through the array
        {
            if(val.contains(nums[i])) return true; // Check if the current element is already in the HashSet. If it is, it means we have a duplicate within distance k.

            val.add(nums[i]); // Add the current element to the HashSet

            if(i >= k) val.remove(nums[i-k]); // Maintain the sliding window of size k+1.  If i >= k, the element nums[i-k] is outside the window, so we remove it from the HashSet.
        }

        return false; // If we reach the end of the array without finding duplicates, return false.
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`HashSet<Integer> val = new HashSet<>();`**: This line initializes an empty `HashSet` called `val`.  This set will store the elements within our sliding window.

2.  **`for(int i = 0 ; i<nums.length ; i++)`**: This loop iterates through each element of the input array `nums`.

3.  **`if(val.contains(nums[i])) return true;`**:  This is the core of the duplicate detection.  It checks if the current element `nums[i]` already exists in the `val` set.  If it does, it means we've encountered this element before within the current sliding window (i.e., within a distance of `k`), so we immediately return `true` because we've found a nearby duplicate.

4.  **`val.add(nums[i]);`**: If the current element `nums[i]` is not already in the `val` set (meaning it's not a duplicate within the window), we add it to the set.

5.  **`if(i >= k) val.remove(nums[i-k]);`**: This part maintains the sliding window.  If the current index `i` is greater than or equal to `k`, it means the element that was `k` positions before the current element (`nums[i-k]`) is now outside the window of size `k+1`.  Therefore, we remove it from the `val` set to ensure that the set only contains elements within the current window.

6.  **`return false;`**: If the loop completes without finding any nearby duplicates, we reach this line and return `false`.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the `nums` array.  We iterate through the array once. The `contains`, `add`, and `remove` operations on the `HashSet` take O(1) time on average.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(min(n, k)), where n is the length of the `nums` array and k is the given integer. In the worst-case scenario (where there are no duplicates), the `HashSet` will store up to `k+1` elements. However, the maximum number of unique elements in the array is `n`, so the space complexity is bounded by the minimum of `n` and `k+1`, which can be simplified to `O(min(n,k))`.
