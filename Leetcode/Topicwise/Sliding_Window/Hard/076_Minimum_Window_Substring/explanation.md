## Minimum Window Substring: A Detailed Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The "Minimum Window Substring" problem asks us to find the smallest substring within a larger string `s` that contains all the characters of another string `t`.  If no such substring exists, we return an empty string.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

This solution employs a **sliding window** technique.  We maintain a window within the string `s`.  The window expands to the right until it contains all characters of `t` (with correct frequencies). Then, the window contracts from the left, trying to shrink the window while still containing all characters from `t`. This process continues until the entire string `s` is traversed. We track the smallest window found so far.

This approach is efficient because it avoids redundant checks. Instead of checking every possible substring, it intelligently expands and contracts the window based on the presence of characters from `t`.

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * `HashMap<Character, Integer>`: Two HashMaps (`mapt` and `mapw`) are used to store the character frequencies. `mapt` stores the frequencies of characters in the target string `t`, and `mapw` stores the frequencies of characters within the current window in `s`.  HashMaps provide O(1) average time complexity for insertion, deletion, and lookup.
* **Algorithms:**
    * **Sliding Window:** The core algorithm is a sliding window approach.
    * **HashMap operations:**  `getOrDefault`, `put`, etc., are used for efficient manipulation of HashMaps.

**4. Code Walkthrough:**

```java
class Solution {
    public String minWindow(String s, String t) {
        if(s.length() < t.length()) return ""; //If s is shorter than t, no substring can contain t.

        HashMap<Character , Integer> mapt = new HashMap<>(); //Frequency map for t
        HashMap<Character , Integer> mapw = new HashMap<>(); //Frequency map for the window

        for(char c : t.toCharArray()) mapt.put(c , mapt.getOrDefault(c , 0)+1); //Populate mapt

        int l = 0; //Left pointer of the window
        int c = 0; //Counter for characters from t found in the window
        int len = Integer.MAX_VALUE; //Length of the minimum window (initialized to maximum)
        int ind = 0; //Starting index of the minimum window

        for(int r = 0 ; r<s.length() ; r++) { //Main sliding window loop
            char ch = s.charAt(r); //Current character
            mapw.put(ch , mapw.getOrDefault(ch , 0) + 1); //Add to window map

            if(mapt.containsKey(ch) && mapt.get(ch).intValue() == mapw.get(ch).intValue()) c++; //Increment counter if a character from t is completely matched in the window

            while(c==mapt.size()) { //Window contains all characters from t
                if(r-l+1 < len) { //Check for minimum length
                    len = r-l+1;
                    ind = l;
                }
                char lc = s.charAt(l++); //Shrink the window from left
                mapw.put(lc , mapw.get(lc)-1); //Update window map
                if(mapt.containsKey(lc) && mapw.get(lc) < mapt.get(lc)) c--; //Decrement counter if a character from t is no longer completely matched
            }
        }

        return (len == Integer.MAX_VALUE)?"":s.substring(ind , ind+len); //Return the result
    }
}
```

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(s), where s is the length of string `s`.  The outer loop iterates through `s` once. The `while` loop, while nested, doesn't significantly increase the time complexity because in the worst case, the left pointer moves at most `s` times.  HashMap operations are O(1) on average.

* **Space Complexity:** O(t), where t is the length of string `t`. The space complexity is dominated by the two HashMaps, which store the character frequencies of `t` and the window.  In the worst case, the HashMaps can store up to the number of unique characters in `t`.


This solution provides an efficient way to solve the Minimum Window Substring problem using a sliding window and HashMaps.  The use of HashMaps allows for quick lookups and updates of character frequencies, leading to an optimized solution.
