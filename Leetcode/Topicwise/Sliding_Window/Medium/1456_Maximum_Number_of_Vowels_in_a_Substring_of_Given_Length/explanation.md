## Maximum Number of Vowels in a Substring of Given Length: Explained

Here's a detailed breakdown of the Java code provided for solving the "Maximum Number of Vowels in a Substring of Given Length" LeetCode problem.

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to find the maximum number of vowel letters ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') present in any substring of length `k` within a given string `s`.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The approach employed is the **Sliding Window** technique. Here's why this approach is suitable:

*   **Substring Requirement:** We need to examine contiguous substrings of a fixed length `k`.
*   **Efficiency:**  Iterating through all possible substrings of length `k` would be inefficient (O(n\*k)). The sliding window allows us to achieve this in O(n) time.

The core idea is to maintain a "window" of size `k` that slides through the string `s`.  We keep track of the number of vowels within the current window. As the window slides, we update the vowel count by:

*   Adding the new character entering the window (if it's a vowel).
*   Subtracting the character leaving the window (if it's a vowel).

At each step, we update the maximum number of vowels seen so far.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `HashSet`: Used to efficiently check if a character is a vowel (O(1) lookup time).
*   **Algorithms:**
    *   **Sliding Window:**  The primary algorithmic technique.  This helps to iterate through all possible substrings of size k efficiently.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxVowels(String s, int k) {
        Set<Character> vow = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'));
        int n = s.length();
        int l = 0;
        int max = 0;
        int cnt = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i<n; i++) {
            if(vow.contains(s.charAt(i))) cnt++;
            while(i-l+1 > k) {
                if(vow.contains(s.charAt(l))) cnt--;
                l++;
            }
            if(i-l+1 == k) max = Math.max(max, cnt);
        }

        return max;
    }
}
```

*   **`Set<Character> vow = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'));`:**
    *   Creates a `HashSet` called `vow` containing all the vowel characters. This allows for quick lookups to determine if a character is a vowel or not.

*   **`int n = s.length();`:**
    *   Gets the length of the input string `s` and stores it in the variable `n`.

*   **`int l = 0;`:**
    *   `l` represents the left boundary (starting index) of the sliding window. Initialized to 0.

*   **`int max = 0;`:**
    *   `max` stores the maximum number of vowels found in any substring of length `k`. Initialized to 0.

*   **`int cnt = 0;`:**
    *   `cnt` stores the current number of vowels within the sliding window. Initialized to 0.

*   **`for(int i = 0; i<n; i++) { ... }`:**
    *   This loop iterates through the string `s` character by character, with `i` representing the right boundary (ending index) of the sliding window.

*   **`if(vow.contains(s.charAt(i))) cnt++;`:**
    *   Checks if the character at the current index `i` is a vowel. If it is, increment the vowel count `cnt`.  We're effectively adding the new character to the window.

*   **`while(i-l+1 > k) { ... }`:**
    *   This `while` loop shrinks the window from the left if the current window size (`i - l + 1`) exceeds `k`.
    *   **`if(vow.contains(s.charAt(l))) cnt--;`:** If the character at the left boundary `l` of the window is a vowel, decrement the vowel count `cnt`.  We're removing the character from the window.
    *   **`l++;`:**  Move the left boundary `l` of the window one step to the right.

*   **`if(i-l+1 == k) max = Math.max(max, cnt);`:**
    *   If the current window size is exactly `k`, update the `max` variable with the maximum value between the current `max` and the current vowel count `cnt`.

*   **`return max;`:**
    *   After iterating through the entire string, return the maximum number of vowels found in any substring of length `k`.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. The `for` loop iterates through the string once. The `while` loop inside also iterates at most `n` times in total because `l` only increments. The `HashSet` lookups (`vow.contains()`) take O(1) time.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1).  The `HashSet` `vow` uses constant space (always stores the 5 vowels). We use a few integer variables, so the space used is constant and independent of the input string's size.
