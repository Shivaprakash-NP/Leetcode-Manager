## LeetCode: Maximum Points You Can Obtain from Cards - Solution Explained

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the maximum sum of points we can obtain from a circular array of cards. We are allowed to pick exactly `k` cards, and we can pick them from either the beginning or the end of the array.  The goal is to maximize the total points collected.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The most straightforward approach would be to try all possible combinations of picking `k` cards, but this has exponential time complexity (O(2<sup>n</sup>)).  Instead, we can use a sliding window technique combined with a clever observation.

The core idea is this:  We first calculate the sum of the first `k` cards.  Then, instead of exploring all combinations, we iteratively slide a window of size `k` across the array.  Each slide involves subtracting a card from the beginning of the current window and adding a card from the end.  This efficiently explores all possibilities of picking `k` cards from both ends of the array without redundant calculations. This approach leverages the circular nature of the problem (we can pick from the beginning and end).

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:** We primarily use an array (`cardPoints`) to store the points on each card.
* **Algorithms:** The core algorithm is a sliding window approach.  We also use a simple iterative loop for the initial sum calculation and for sliding the window.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxScore(int[] cardPoints, int k) {
        int n = cardPoints.length;
        int total = 0;

        // Calculate the sum of the first k cards
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) total += cardPoints[i];
        
        int max = total; // Initialize max with the initial sum

        // Slide the window of size k
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            total -= cardPoints[k - 1 - i];        // Remove the card from the beginning of the window
            total += cardPoints[n - 1 - i];        // Add the card from the end of the array
            max = Math.max(max, total);           // Update max if necessary
        }

        return max;
    }
}
```

* **`int n = cardPoints.length;`**: This line gets the length of the `cardPoints` array.
* **`int total = 0;`**: This initializes a variable to store the running sum of the current window.
* **`for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) total += cardPoints[i];`**: This loop calculates the sum of the first `k` cards.
* **`int max = total;`**: This initializes `max` to the initial sum, setting a baseline for comparison.
* **`for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) { ... }`**: This loop iterates `k` times, simulating the sliding window.
    * **`total -= cardPoints[k - 1 - i];`**: Subtracts the card at the beginning of the current window.  Note the `k - 1 - i` index, which correctly decrements from the `k-1` position.
    * **`total += cardPoints[n - 1 - i];`**: Adds the card at the end of the array.  Again, the index is calculated to correctly access elements from the end.
    * **`max = Math.max(max, total);`**: Updates `max` if the current `total` is greater.
* **`return max;`**: Returns the maximum sum found.

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(k). The initial sum calculation takes O(k) time, and the sliding window loop also iterates k times. Therefore, the overall time complexity is linear with respect to `k`.
* **Space Complexity:** O(1). The solution uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.  We only use a few integer variables.


This solution provides an efficient way to solve the "Maximum Points You Can Obtain from Cards" problem, significantly improving upon a brute-force approach. The sliding window technique is key to achieving the optimal linear time complexity.
