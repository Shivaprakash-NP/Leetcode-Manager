## Minimum Operations to Reduce X to Zero - LeetCode Solution Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the minimum number of operations needed to reduce a given integer `x` to zero.  In each operation, we can either remove elements from the beginning or the end of a given integer array `nums`. The sum of the removed elements must equal `x`. If it's impossible to reduce `x` to zero using this method, we return -1.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution employs a two-pointer sliding window technique combined with a prefix sum concept. The core idea is to find the longest subarray whose sum is equal to `sum(nums) - x`.  Why? Because removing this subarray from `nums` leaves us with a remaining sum equal to `x`, achieving our goal. The length of this subarray represents the number of elements *not* removed; subtracting this length from the total length of `nums` gives us the minimum number of elements to remove (and hence the minimum operations).

This approach is efficient because it avoids exhaustive enumeration of all possible subarray combinations.  The sliding window allows us to dynamically adjust the subarray while efficiently tracking its sum.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**  The primary data structure used is an integer array (`nums`).
* **Algorithms:** The core algorithm used is a two-pointer sliding window technique.  We also implicitly utilize a prefix sum approach (though not explicitly stored) by accumulating the sum of the elements within the sliding window.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums, int x) {
        int sum = 0;
        for(int v : nums) sum+=v; // Calculate the total sum of the array

        int subsum = 0; // Sum of the current sliding window
        int l = 0; // Left pointer of the sliding window
        int len = -1; // Length of the longest subarray with sum = sum(nums) - x; initialized to -1 (indicating no such subarray found yet)
        for(int r = 0 ; r < nums.length ; r++) { // Iterate through the array with the right pointer
            subsum += nums[r]; // Expand the window to the right

            while(l<=r && subsum > sum-x) { // Shrink the window from the left if the sum exceeds sum(nums) - x
                subsum -= nums[l++]; // Move the left pointer and reduce the sum
            }

            if(subsum == sum-x) len = Math.max(len , r-l+1); //If the subarray sum matches, update the maximum length
        }

        return (len == -1)?-1:nums.length-len; // Return the minimum operations or -1 if no solution exists
    }
}
```

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the length of the `nums` array.  The outer loop iterates through the array once, and the inner `while` loop, in the worst case, iterates through the array once as well.  However, the total number of iterations across both loops is still linearly proportional to N.

* **Space Complexity:** O(1). The solution uses only a few integer variables to store the sum, subsum, pointers, and length.  The space used is constant regardless of the input array size.  Therefore, the space complexity is O(1).
