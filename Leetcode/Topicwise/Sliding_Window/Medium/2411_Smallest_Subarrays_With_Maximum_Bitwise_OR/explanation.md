## LeetCode Problem: Smallest Subarrays With Maximum Bitwise OR

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the length of the smallest subarray, starting from each index `i`,  whose elements' bitwise OR results in the maximum possible bitwise OR for the entire array.  In other words, for each starting index, we need to find the minimum number of elements that, when bitwise-OR'ed together, yield the maximum OR value achievable from the input array.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution cleverly uses a bit manipulation approach to efficiently solve this problem.  Instead of iterating through all possible subarrays for each starting index (which would be highly inefficient), it analyzes the bits individually.  The core idea is this:

* **Maximum Bitwise OR:**  The maximum bitwise OR of the entire array is pre-calculated (implicitly).  A bit is set in the maximum OR if it's set in *at least one* number in the array.

* **Rightmost Boundary:** For each starting index `i`, we find the rightmost index `r` that includes all the necessary elements to achieve the maximum OR.  The rightmost index is determined by scanning the bits. If a bit is 1 in the maximum OR, we need to find the rightmost occurrence of that bit within the array (starting from the current index).

* **Iterating Backwards:** The algorithm iterates from the end of the array backwards.  This allows us to efficiently find the rightmost occurrences of each significant bit as we move left.

* **Bitwise Operations:** By using bitwise operations (`&` and `>>`), the code efficiently checks the bits of each number and identifies the rightmost positions of the bits necessary to obtain the maximum bitwise OR.

This approach is chosen for its efficiency. A brute-force approach checking all subarrays would have O(n^2) time complexity. This solution achieves linear time complexity.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * `int[] nums`: Input array of integers.
    * `int[] ans`: Output array storing the lengths of the smallest subarrays.
    * `int[] map`: Array to store the rightmost indices of each bit (0-31).

* **Algorithms:**
    * **Bit manipulation:**  Using bitwise AND (`&`), right bit shift (`>>`), and other operations.
    * **Iteration:**  Iterating through the array from right to left.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **`int[] ans = new int[n];`**: Initializes an array to store the result (length of smallest subarrays).

* **`int[] map = new int[32]; Arrays.fill(map, -1);`**: Creates an array `map` of size 32 (representing 32 bits).  Initially, all indices are set to -1, indicating that no bit position has been encountered yet.

* **`for(int i = n-1; i>=0; i--)`**: Iterates through the array from the last element to the first.

* **`int tem = nums[i];`**: Copies the current number for processing.

* **`int r = i;`**: Initializes `r` (rightmost index) to the current index `i`.

* **`for(int j = 0; j<32; j++)`**: Iterates through each bit (0-31).

* **`if((tem&1) == 1)`**: Checks if the least significant bit is set.

* **`map[j] = i;`**: If the bit is set, update the rightmost index for that bit in `map`.

* **`tem = tem>>1;`**: Right-shifts `tem` by 1 bit, moving to the next bit.

* **`if(map[j] != -1) r = Math.max(r, map[j]);`**: If a rightmost index is found for the bit (`map[j] != -1`), update `r` to be the maximum of `r` and `map[j]`, effectively expanding the right boundary as needed.

* **`ans[i] = r-i+1;`**: Calculates the length of the smallest subarray and stores it in `ans`.

* **`return ans;`**: Returns the result array.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(n*k), where n is the length of the input array and k is the number of bits (32 in this case).  While technically O(n), it's linear with a constant factor of 32, making it very efficient. The nested loops iterate a total of 32n times, making it linear in terms of the input size.

* **Space Complexity:** O(k), where k is the number of bits (32). The space used is dominated by the `map` array.  This is constant space complexity in practice because k is fixed. The `ans` array also uses O(n) space, but it's the output array, so it's generally not considered part of the space complexity analysis.

In summary, the algorithm is efficient because it cleverly utilizes bit manipulation to avoid explicitly checking all possible subarrays, resulting in a linear time complexity solution.
