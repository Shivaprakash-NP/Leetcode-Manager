## Minimum Size Subarray Sum - LeetCode Problem Explained

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the minimum length of a contiguous subarray within a given array `nums` whose sum is greater than or equal to a specified `target`. If no such subarray exists, we return 0.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

This solution employs a **sliding window** technique.  We use two pointers, `l` (left) and `r` (right), to define a window within the `nums` array. The `r` pointer expands the window by including more elements, while the `l` pointer shrinks the window to maintain the condition `sum >= target`.

This approach is chosen because it's efficient for problems involving finding subarrays or subsequences that satisfy a certain condition.  Brute-force approaches (checking all possible subarrays) would have a much higher time complexity.  The sliding window optimizes by only expanding and contracting the window as needed.

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**  The primary data structure is the input array `nums` itself.  We also implicitly use a sliding window, represented by the pointers `l` and `r`.
* **Algorithms:** The core algorithm is a variation of the two-pointer technique, specifically the sliding window approach.  We use a `while` loop to dynamically adjust the window size based on the current sum.  The `Math.min()` function is used to track the minimum subarray length.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

```java
class Solution {
    public int minSubArrayLen(int target, int[] nums) {
        int ans = Integer.MAX_VALUE; // Initialize the minimum length to the maximum possible integer value.
        int sum = 0; // Initialize the sum of the current window.
        int l = 0; // Initialize the left pointer of the window.
        for(int r = 0 ; r < nums.length ; r++) { // Iterate through the array with the right pointer.
            sum+=nums[r]; // Add the current element to the sum.

            while(sum>=target) { // While the sum is greater than or equal to the target:
                ans = Math.min(ans , r-l+1); // Update the minimum length with the current window's length.
                sum -= nums[l++]; // Subtract the leftmost element and move the left pointer to shrink the window.
            }
        }

        return (ans==Integer.MAX_VALUE)?0:ans; // Return 0 if no subarray met the condition, otherwise return the minimum length.
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Initialization:** `ans` is initialized to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` to ensure that any valid subarray length will be smaller. `sum` and `l` are initialized to 0.
* **Outer Loop:** The outer loop iterates through the array using the right pointer `r`, expanding the window.  Each iteration adds the current element `nums[r]` to `sum`.
* **Inner Loop (While Loop):**  The inner loop executes as long as the current window's sum (`sum`) is greater than or equal to the target. Inside the loop:
    * `ans = Math.min(ans, r - l + 1);` updates `ans` to the minimum length encountered so far.
    * `sum -= nums[l++];` removes the leftmost element from the sum and moves the left pointer `l` to the right, shrinking the window.
* **Return Value:** If `ans` remains `Integer.MAX_VALUE` after the loops, it means no subarray met the condition, so 0 is returned. Otherwise, the minimum length `ans` is returned.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the length of the input array `nums`.  The outer loop iterates through the array once, and in the worst case, the inner loop iterates through the array once as well (when the entire array sums to the target).  Therefore, the total number of iterations is at most 2N, which simplifies to O(N).

* **Space Complexity:** O(1). The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space to store variables like `ans`, `sum`, `l`, and `r`, regardless of the input array size.  The space used does not scale with the input size.
