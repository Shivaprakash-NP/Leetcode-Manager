## LeetCode: Count Number of Maximum Bitwise-OR Subsets - Solution Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the number of subsets of a given integer array `nums` whose bitwise OR operation results in the maximum possible value achievable from any subset of `nums`.  In simpler terms, we need to count how many subsets have the largest possible bitwise OR value.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore all possible subsets of the input array.  It efficiently avoids redundant computations by calculating the maximum possible bitwise OR value beforehand. This maximum value is then used as a benchmark during the DFS traversal, counting only those subsets that achieve this maximum.

This approach was chosen because it systematically explores all possible subsets.  A brute-force approach of generating all subsets and calculating their OR values would be less efficient.  Calculating the maximum OR value first optimizes the process by eliminating subsets that are guaranteed not to reach the maximum.

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**  The primary data structure is the input array `nums` which stores the integers.  No other significant data structures are used explicitly. The `max` and `ans` variables act as simple counters.
* **Algorithms:** The core algorithm is Depth-First Search (DFS) which is used to explore the power set (set of all subsets) of the input array. The bitwise OR operation (`|`) is used to calculate the OR value of each subset.

**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **`max = 0; ans = 0;`**: Initializes `max` (to store the maximum bitwise OR) and `ans` (to count subsets with maximum OR) to 0.
* **`private void dfs(int[] nums, int i, int orval)`**: This recursive function performs the depth-first search.
    * **`if(i == nums.length)`**: Base case: If we've reached the end of the array (explored all elements), we check if the current `orval` matches the maximum `max`. If they match, we increment `ans`.
    * **`dfs(nums, i+1, orval | nums[i]);`**: Recursive call:  Includes the current element `nums[i]` in the subset and updates `orval` accordingly.
    * **`dfs(nums, i+1, orval);`**: Recursive call: Excludes the current element `nums[i]` from the subset.  This explores both possibilities for each element.
* **`public int countMaxOrSubsets(int[] nums)`**: This is the main function.
    * **`for(int v : nums) max |= v;`**: This loop efficiently calculates the maximum possible bitwise OR value by ORing all elements of `nums`. This is a crucial optimization because it avoids unnecessary computations during the DFS.
    * **`dfs(nums, 0, 0);`**: Starts the DFS traversal from the beginning of the array with an initial `orval` of 0.
    * **`return ans;`**: Returns the final count of subsets with the maximum bitwise OR value.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(2<sup>n</sup>), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because the DFS explores all 2<sup>n</sup> possible subsets.  The initial calculation of `max` takes O(n) time, which is dominated by the exponential time complexity of the DFS.

* **Space Complexity:** O(n) in the worst case. This is due to the recursive call stack of the DFS, which could potentially reach a depth of n in the worst case (when no early termination occurs). The space used by the `nums` array itself is O(n), but this is considered part of the input and not accounted for when determining space complexity.


In summary, the provided code efficiently solves the "Count Number of Maximum Bitwise-OR Subsets" problem using a depth-first search strategy combined with a pre-computation step to determine the maximum possible bitwise OR value. This approach is significantly more efficient than a naive brute-force method.
