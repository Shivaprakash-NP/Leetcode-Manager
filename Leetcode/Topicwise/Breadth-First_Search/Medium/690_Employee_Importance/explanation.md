## Employee Importance Problem Explanation

Here's a detailed explanation of the provided Java code for the "Employee Importance" LeetCode problem.

### 1. Problem Understanding

The problem asks us to calculate the total importance value of a given employee and all their subordinates in a company hierarchy. Each employee has an ID, an importance value, and a list of subordinate IDs.  We are given a list of all employees and the ID of the target employee. The goal is to return the sum of the importance values of the target employee and all employees who directly or indirectly report to them.  The hierarchy is a tree structure where each employee can have multiple subordinates.

### 2. Approach / Intuition

The core idea is to use Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the employee hierarchy starting from the given employee.  We treat the employee-subordinate relationships as edges in a tree.

Here's the reasoning:

*   **DFS is suitable for traversing trees:** We need to visit each employee in the subtree rooted at the given employee. DFS naturally does this.
*   **Summing importance along the way:** As we visit each employee during the DFS traversal, we add their importance value to the total sum.
*   **Using a Map for quick employee lookup:** To efficiently access employee information (importance and subordinates) given their ID, we store the employees in a HashMap (id -> Employee). This avoids iterating through the employee list every time we need to find an employee.

The algorithm works as follows:

1.  **Build the Employee Map:** Create a HashMap that maps employee IDs to Employee objects.
2.  **Start DFS:** Call a recursive DFS function starting from the given employee's ID.
3.  **DFS Logic:**
    *   Get the employee object using the employee ID.
    *   Initialize a `sum` to the employee's importance value.
    *   Iterate through the employee's subordinates' IDs.
    *   Recursively call the DFS function for each subordinate and add the result to the `sum`.
    *   Return the total `sum`.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms

*   **HashMap (Map<Integer, Employee>):**  Used for efficient lookup of employees by their IDs. It allows O(1) average-case time complexity for retrieving an employee's information.
*   **List<Employee>:** The input list of employees.
*   **List<Integer>:** Each employee has a `subordinates` list which is a list of integers.
*   **Depth-First Search (DFS):** A graph/tree traversal algorithm used to explore the employee hierarchy.  The recursion provides the DFS implementation.

### 4. Code Walkthrough

```java
/*
// Definition for Employee.
class Employee {
    public int id;
    public int importance;
    public List<Integer> subordinates;
};
*/

class Solution {
    private int dfs(Map<Integer, Employee> map, int id) {
        // Base Case (Implicit): If the employee has no subordinates, their total importance is just their own.
        if(map.get(id).subordinates.isEmpty()) return map.get(id).importance;

        // Recursive Step: Calculate the total importance of the employee and their subordinates.
        int sum = map.get(id).importance; // Start with the current employee's importance
        for(int i : map.get(id).subordinates) sum += dfs(map, i); // Recursively add the importance of each subordinate

        return sum; // Return the total importance of the employee and their subtree
    }
    
    public int getImportance(List<Employee> employees, int id) {
        // Create a map to store employees by their ID for faster lookup.
        Map<Integer, Employee> map = new HashMap<>();
        for(Employee e : employees) map.put(e.id, e);

        // Call the DFS function to calculate the total importance.
        return dfs(map, id);
    }
}
```

*   **`Employee` Class:** (Provided, not implemented in the code snippet) Represents an employee with `id`, `importance`, and a list of `subordinates` (their IDs).

*   **`dfs(Map<Integer, Employee> map, int id)` Function:**
    *   **`if(map.get(id).subordinates.isEmpty()) return map.get(id).importance;`**: This is the base case for the recursion. If the employee has no subordinates, it returns their own importance. This stops the recursion.

    *   **`int sum = map.get(id).importance;`**: Initializes a variable `sum` to the importance of the current employee.

    *   **`for(int i : map.get(id).subordinates) sum += dfs(map, i);`**:  Iterates through the list of subordinate IDs. For each subordinate, it recursively calls the `dfs` function and adds the returned value (the total importance of that subordinate and their subtree) to the `sum`.

    *   **`return sum;`**: Returns the total importance of the employee and their entire subtree.

*   **`getImportance(List<Employee> employees, int id)` Function:**
    *   **`Map<Integer, Employee> map = new HashMap<>();`**: Creates a new HashMap to store the employees, mapping their ID to the `Employee` object.

    *   **`for(Employee e : employees) map.put(e.id, e);`**: Iterates through the input list of `employees` and populates the `map`.

    *   **`return dfs(map, id);`**: Calls the `dfs` function starting from the given `id` and returns the result.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity

*   **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of employees.
    *   Building the `map` takes O(N) time.
    *   The `dfs` function visits each employee once (in the worst case), so it also takes O(N) time.  The `dfs` explores each employee and their direct and indirect subordinates. Since we only consider each node once, it will run in O(N) time.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(N)
    *   The `map` stores all employees, which requires O(N) space.
    *   The recursion depth of the `dfs` function can be at most N in the worst case (e.g., a linear hierarchy), so the call stack can take O(N) space.
