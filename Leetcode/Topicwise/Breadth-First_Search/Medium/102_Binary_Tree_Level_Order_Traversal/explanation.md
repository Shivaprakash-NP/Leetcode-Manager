## LeetCode: Binary Tree Level Order Traversal - Detailed Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to traverse a binary tree level by level and return a list of lists, where each inner list represents the nodes at a particular level.  In simpler terms, we need to print the tree's nodes layer by layer from top to bottom.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The most efficient way to solve this problem is using Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS explores a graph (or in this case, a tree) level by level. We utilize a queue data structure to achieve this.  We start by adding the root node to the queue. Then, in each iteration, we process all nodes currently in the queue (representing a level), add their children to the queue for the next level, and collect their values into a sub-list. This process repeats until the queue is empty, indicating that all levels have been processed.  This approach is chosen because it directly reflects the level-order traversal requirement.  Other approaches like Depth-First Search (DFS) would require more complex logic to achieve the level-order output.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * `Queue<TreeNode>`:  A queue is used to implement BFS.  It stores `TreeNode` objects waiting to be processed.  `LinkedList` is used as the underlying implementation for its efficient `add()` and `poll()` operations.
    * `List<List<Integer>>`: A list of lists of integers is used to store the result. Each inner list represents a level in the tree, containing the values of the nodes at that level.
    * `List<Integer>`: An inner list to store the values of nodes in a single level.

* **Algorithms:**
    * **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** The core algorithm used to traverse the tree level by level.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

```java
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> levelOrder(TreeNode root) {
        List<List<Integer>> ans = new ArrayList<>(); // Initialize the result list
        Queue<TreeNode> q = new LinkedList<>(); // Initialize the queue for BFS
        if(root == null) return ans; // Handle empty tree case
        q.add(root); // Add the root node to the queue

        while(!q.isEmpty()) { // Continue until the queue is empty
            int n = q.size(); // Get the number of nodes at the current level
            List<Integer> sub = new ArrayList<>(); // Create a sub-list for the current level

            for(int i = 0 ; i<n ; i++) { // Process all nodes at the current level
                if(q.peek().left != null) 
                    q.add(q.peek().left); // Add left child to the queue
                if(q.peek().right != null) 
                    q.add(q.peek().right); // Add right child to the queue
                sub.add(q.poll().val); // Add the current node's value to the sub-list and remove it from the queue
            }
            ans.add(sub); // Add the sub-list (current level's nodes) to the result list
        }
        return ans; // Return the result
    }
}
```

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree.  Each node is visited and processed exactly once.

* **Space Complexity:** O(W), where W is the maximum width (maximum number of nodes at any level) of the binary tree. In the worst-case scenario (a complete binary tree), W can be equal to N. The space complexity is dominated by the queue which holds nodes at each level.  In a skewed tree, the space complexity could be O(log N) or even O(1) in extreme cases.  The space for the `ans` list is also proportional to N because it stores all the node values.


In summary, this solution efficiently implements a level-order traversal of a binary tree using BFS, offering optimal time complexity and space complexity proportional to the maximum width of the tree.  The code is clear, concise, and handles edge cases like an empty tree.
