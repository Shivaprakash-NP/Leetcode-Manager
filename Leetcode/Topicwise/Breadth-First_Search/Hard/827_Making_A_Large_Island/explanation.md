## LeetCode: Making A Large Island - Detailed Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the size of the largest island (connected component of 1s) in a given binary grid.  We can potentially increase the size of an island by flipping a single 0 to a 1. The goal is to find the maximum possible island size after potentially flipping at most one 0.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution employs a Union-Find algorithm to efficiently identify and merge connected components of 1s in the grid.  

* **Union-Find:** This algorithm excels at efficiently determining connectedness and managing the size of connected components. We use it to first identify all the islands in the grid. 
* **Iterating through Zeros:** After identifying initial islands, we iterate through each 0 in the grid. For each 0, we check its adjacent cells. If adjacent cells belong to different islands, we calculate the potential new island size by summing the sizes of those connected components and adding 1 (for the 0 we flipped). 
* **Tracking Maximum Island Size:** We maintain a variable to track the maximum island size encountered so far, updating it whenever a larger potential island is found.

This approach is chosen because Union-Find provides a very efficient way to manage the merging and sizing of islands compared to alternative approaches like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) that would need to be repeatedly run.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * `par`: A parent array for the Union-Find algorithm. `par[i]` stores the parent of element `i` in the Union-Find structure.  Elements are represented as flattened indices from the 2D grid.
    * `size`: An array storing the size of each connected component in the Union-Find structure.
    * `vis`: A boolean array to mark visited cells in the grid during the initial island identification phase.
    * `HashSet<Integer>`:  Used to efficiently track unique island IDs when considering a potential flip of a 0.
    * `int[][]`: The input grid represented as a 2D integer array.
    * `int[][] dir`: An array to represent the four cardinal directions for traversing the grid.

* **Algorithms:**
    * **Union-Find:** Used to efficiently merge connected components and track their sizes.
    * **Iterative Traversal:** The grid is traversed iteratively to identify islands and assess potential flips of 0s.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **Initialization:** The code initializes the `par` and `size` arrays for the Union-Find structure, setting each element to be its own parent with a size of 1.  A `vis` array to track visited cells is created.

* **Island Identification:**  The nested loop iterates through the grid. If a cell contains a 1 and hasn't been visited, it initiates a depth-first search (implicitly through the recursive `union` function) to find and merge all connected components of 1s that share the same parent.

* **Union-Find Operations:**  The `find` function finds the root parent of a given element (using path compression), and the `union` function merges two connected components (using union by size for optimization).

* **Processing Zeros:**  Another nested loop iterates through the grid, this time focusing on cells containing 0s.  For each 0, it checks adjacent cells. If an adjacent cell is a 1, it adds its root parent (obtained using `find`) to a `HashSet` to avoid duplicates. The sum of the sizes of these unique island IDs plus 1 (for the 0 itself) gives the potential size of the new island if the 0 is flipped to 1. The maximum size is tracked in the `ans` variable.

* **Result:** Finally, the code returns `ans`, which holds the maximum size of the island after potentially flipping one 0.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(N*M), where N and M are the dimensions of the grid.  The Union-Find operations have an amortized time complexity close to O(1) due to path compression and union by size. The nested loops iterate through each cell of the grid.

* **Space Complexity:** O(N*M), dominated primarily by the `par`, `size`, and `vis` arrays, which all have the same dimensions as the input grid.  The `HashSet` has a size limited to the number of islands at maximum.  


The solution is efficient because it avoids redundant work by cleverly using the Union-Find data structure. The use of path compression and union by size optimizes the Union-Find operations, leading to a fast algorithm.
