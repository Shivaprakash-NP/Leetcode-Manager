## LeetCode: Word Ladder - Detailed Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The "Word Ladder" problem asks for the shortest transformation sequence from a `beginWord` to an `endWord`, where each intermediate word differs from the previous word by only one letter, and all words are of the same length.  The available words are provided in a `wordList`. If no such transformation sequence exists, the function should return 0.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

This solution employs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is ideal here because it guarantees finding the shortest path (transformation sequence) first.  The core idea is to build a graph where each node represents a word, and an edge exists between two words if they differ by only one letter.  Then, BFS is used to traverse this graph, starting from `beginWord` and searching for `endWord`.

The code cleverly avoids explicitly building the graph. Instead, it uses a HashMap (`map`) to store intermediate patterns. A pattern is created by replacing one character with "*". For example, "hot" would generate patterns "hot", "*ot", "h*t", "ho*". This allows for efficient lookup of words that are one letter away from a given word.

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **HashMap (`map`):** Stores intermediate patterns as keys and a list of words matching each pattern as values. This allows for efficient lookups of words one letter away from the current word.
* **HashSet (`vis`):** A set to keep track of visited words during BFS to prevent cycles and redundant exploration.
* **Queue (`q`):**  A queue is used to implement the BFS algorithm, ensuring that words at the same distance from the `beginWord` are processed together.
* **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** The core algorithm used to find the shortest path in the implicit graph.

**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **Lines 1-2:** Checks if `endWord` is present in `wordList`. If not, a transformation is impossible, so 0 is returned.

* **Lines 4-9:** This section preprocesses the `wordList` to build the `map`.  It iterates through each word, generating all possible one-letter-different patterns ("*ot", "h*t", "ho*") and associating these patterns with the original words in the `map`.

* **Lines 11-14:** Initializes a queue (`q`) with the `beginWord`, a visited set (`vis`) containing `beginWord`, and a step counter (`step`) initialized to 1.

* **Lines 16-26:** This is the main BFS loop.  It continues until the queue is empty.  The inner loop processes all nodes at the current distance.  It checks if the polled word `s` is equal to `endWord`. If it is, `step` (the shortest path length) is returned. Otherwise, it generates all possible patterns for `s`, retrieves associated words from `map`, adds unvisited words to the queue (`q`) and marks them as visited in `vis`.

* **Line 28:** If the loop completes without finding `endWord`, it means there's no path, so 0 is returned.

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity: O(M*N + M*L),** where M is the length of `wordList`, N is the length of each word, and L is the average length of word lists corresponding to each pattern (it is generally less than M).  Building the `map` takes O(M*N) time. The BFS loop iterates through at most all words in `wordList`, and for each word, it iterates through its neighbours. In the worst case, this could approach O(M*L).

* **Space Complexity: O(M*N),** dominated by the space used by `map`.  In the worst case, each word generates N patterns, and each pattern may be associated with almost all words.  `q` and `vis` also consume space, but their size is at most M and is generally significantly less than M*N.


This solution provides an efficient way to solve the Word Ladder problem. Using BFS ensures finding the shortest transformation sequence, while the use of a HashMap for pattern-based lookup optimizes the search process.  The time complexity could be further improved using techniques like Trie data structure but adds considerable complexity for only marginal gain in many cases.
