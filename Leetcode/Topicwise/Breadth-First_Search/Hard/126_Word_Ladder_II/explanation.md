## LeetCode: Word Ladder II - Detailed Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

Given a begin word, an end word, and a list of words, find all shortest transformation sequences from the begin word to the end word, where each intermediate word differs from the previous word by exactly one letter.  The words in the transformation sequence must all be from the given word list.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

This solution uses a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm combined with Depth-First Search (DFS).

* **BFS:**  BFS is used to find the shortest distance (number of transformations) from the `beginWord` to the `endWord`.  It explores the word space level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches `endWord`, it has found the shortest path.  The `lmap` (level map) stores the shortest distance from `beginWord` to each visited word.

* **DFS:** After BFS identifies the shortest distance, DFS is employed to reconstruct all the shortest transformation sequences.  Starting from `endWord`, it recursively explores words with a distance one step closer to `beginWord`, adding them to the path until it reaches `beginWord`.


This approach is chosen because BFS efficiently finds the shortest path length, and DFS systematically generates all paths of that length.  A purely BFS approach would find *a* shortest path, but not *all* shortest paths.

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * `Queue<String> q`:  Used in BFS to store words to be processed.
    * `Set<String> ws`: A HashSet storing the words from the wordList for efficient lookup.
    * `Map<String, Integer> lmap`:  Stores the level (distance from `beginWord`) of each visited word.
    * `List<List<String>> ans`: Stores the result â€“ a list of lists, where each inner list represents a transformation sequence.
    * `List<String> path`: Used in DFS to track the current transformation sequence.

* **Algorithms:**
    * Breadth-First Search (BFS)
    * Depth-First Search (DFS)


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **`findLadders(String beginWord, String endWord, List<String> wordList)`:**
    * It first checks if `endWord` exists in `wordList`. If not, it returns an empty list.
    * Initializes a `HashSet ws` from `wordList` for efficient lookups.
    * Initializes a `Queue q` with `beginWord`, adds `beginWord` to `lmap` with level 0, and removes it from `ws`.
    * Performs BFS to find shortest distance using the queue, updating `lmap` with levels.
    * If `endWord` is reached, it proceeds to DFS.
    * If `endWord` was reachable it initiates DFS from `endWord`.
    * Returns the list `ans` containing all shortest transformation sequences.

* **`dfs(String s, List<String> path)`:**
    * Recursive DFS function.
    * Base case: If `s` equals `endWord`, reverses the `path` (since DFS builds path in reverse order), adds it to `ans`, and returns.
    * Iterates through each letter of `s`, replacing it with all possible characters.
    * If the modified word (`ns`) exists in `lmap` and its level is one less than `s`'s level, it adds `ns` to the `path`, recursively calls `dfs` with `ns`, and removes `ns` from `path` (backtracking).

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(M * N * 26), where M is the length of the words, and N is the number of words in `wordList`. BFS iterates through the words, and for each word, we explore 26 possibilities (changing each letter). DFS might explore many paths, but the depth is limited by the shortest path length.  In the worst case, all words are connected, leading to the O(M * N * 26) complexity.

* **Space Complexity:** O(M * N) in the worst case.  The `lmap` and `ws` can store all the words,  `ans` could potentially hold a large number of sequences, and the recursion depth of DFS is at most the length of the shortest path.  The space used by the queue in BFS is relatively small compared to the other data structures.


**Improvements:**

The code is already quite efficient. One minor improvement could be to check if `lmap.get(ns) != null`  before calling `lmap.get(ns)` which avoids a potential unnecessary call in `dfs`.  The performance difference would be minimal.
