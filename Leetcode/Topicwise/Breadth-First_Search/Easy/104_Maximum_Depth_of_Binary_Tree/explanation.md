## LeetCode: Maximum Depth of Binary Tree - Solution Explained

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the maximum depth (or height) of a given binary tree.  The depth is defined as the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.  An empty tree has a depth of 0.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The most efficient and intuitive approach to solve this problem is using Depth-First Search (DFS) with recursion.  We traverse the tree recursively, calculating the depth of the left and right subtrees. The maximum depth of the entire tree is then 1 (for the current node) plus the maximum of the depths of its left and right subtrees.  This approach is chosen because it naturally explores all paths in the tree to find the longest one.  Iterative approaches using a stack or queue are possible but add unnecessary complexity for this problem.

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structure:** The problem inherently uses a tree (specifically, a binary tree) as input.  No additional data structures are explicitly created beyond the function call stack used implicitly by recursion.
* **Algorithm:** Depth-First Search (DFS) using recursion.

**4. Code Walkthrough:**

The code consists of two functions:

* **`dep(TreeNode node)`:** This is a recursive helper function that calculates the depth of a subtree rooted at the given `node`.
    * **`if(node == null) return 0;`:** The base case for recursion. If the node is null (empty subtree), the depth is 0.
    * **`int ldep = dep(node.left);`**: Recursively calculates the depth of the left subtree.
    * **`int rdep = dep(node.right);`**: Recursively calculates the depth of the right subtree.
    * **`return 1+Math.max(ldep , rdep);`:**  The depth of the current node is 1 plus the maximum depth of its left and right subtrees. This line combines the results from the recursive calls.

* **`maxDepth(TreeNode root)`:** This function serves as the entry point. It simply calls the `dep` helper function with the root node and returns the result.  This separation improves code readability and organization.

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.  This is because each node is visited exactly once during the traversal.
* **Space Complexity:** O(H), where H is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursive call stack. In the worst case (a completely unbalanced tree), H can be equal to N, resulting in O(N) space complexity.  In the best case (a balanced tree), H is log₂(N), resulting in O(log₂(N)) space complexity.  The space used by the implicit call stack is directly proportional to the height of the tree.


In summary, the provided Java code is an elegant and efficient solution to the "Maximum Depth of Binary Tree" problem, leveraging the power of recursion and DFS to achieve optimal time complexity.  The space complexity depends on the tree's structure but remains reasonably bounded in most practical scenarios.
