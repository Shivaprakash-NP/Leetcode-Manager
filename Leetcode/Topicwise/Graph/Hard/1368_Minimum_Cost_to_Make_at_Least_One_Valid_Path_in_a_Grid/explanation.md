## Minimum Cost to Make at Least One Valid Path in a Grid: Detailed Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the minimum cost to reach the bottom-right cell (destination) of a grid from the top-left cell (starting point).  Each cell in the grid contains a direction (1, 2, 3, or 4 representing right, left, down, and up, respectively). Moving in the direction specified by the cell has a cost of 0; moving in any other direction has a cost of 1.  We need to find the path with the minimum total cost.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

This problem can be efficiently solved using Dijkstra's algorithm (although a modified version is used here due to the specifics of cost). Dijkstra's is ideal for finding the shortest paths in a weighted graph.  In this case, our grid represents the graph, and the cost of moving between cells is the weight of the edges.  We use a deque (double-ended queue) to maintain a priority queue-like structure, optimizing for the 0-cost moves.  Adding elements to the front of the deque prioritizes 0-cost moves ensuring we explore the cheapest paths first.

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * `int[][] grid`: The input grid representing the directions.
    * `int[][] distance`: A 2D array to store the minimum distance from the starting point to each cell.  Initialized with `Integer.MAX_VALUE` to represent infinity.
    * `Deque<int[]> q`: A deque (double-ended queue) used as a priority queue to store cells to be visited.  It stores triplets: `{distance, row, column}`.
    * `int[][] map`: maps direction 1-4 to their respective offset vectors.
    * `int[][] dir`: Contains all possible directions (offsets) (up, down, left, right).


* **Algorithms:**
    * **Dijkstra's Algorithm (modified):** The core algorithm used to find the minimum cost path.  The modification lies in using a deque to prioritize 0-cost moves.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **Initialization:**
    * `n` and `m` store the dimensions of the grid.
    * `distance` array is initialized with `Integer.MAX_VALUE` to represent infinite distances initially.
    * `q` is initialized with the starting cell (0, 0) with a distance of 0.
    * `map` converts the integer direction values to direction vector offsets.
    * `dir` holds all four possible directions as offset vectors.

* **Main Loop (`while (!q.isEmpty())`):**
    * It iterates while the queue is not empty.
    * `p = q.poll()`: It retrieves and removes the cell with the smallest distance from the queue (either front or back depending on the cost).
    * It extracts row (`i`), column (`j`), and distance (`dis`) from `p`.
    * `cdir`: Gets the direction vector from the `grid` cell.
    * **Inner Loop (`for (int[] d : dir)`):**
        * It explores all four possible directions from the current cell.
        * `ni` and `nj` calculate the coordinates of the neighbor cell.
        * **Boundary Check:** Checks if the neighbor is within the grid boundaries.
        * `c`: Calculates the cost of moving to the neighbor cell (0 if the move is in the direction specified by the cell, 1 otherwise).
        * **Distance Update:** If the new distance (`dis + c`) to the neighbor is less than the current distance stored in `distance[ni][nj]`, it updates the distance.
        * **Queue Update:** Adds the neighbor to the queue: at the front if the cost is 0, at the back otherwise. This prioritizes cells reachable with 0 cost.

* **Return Value:**
    * `distance[n - 1][m - 1]`: After the loop, `distance[n - 1][m - 1]` contains the minimum cost to reach the destination cell.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(N*M), where N and M are the number of rows and columns in the grid.  In the worst case, we visit each cell once.  The deque operations (addFirst, addLast, poll) take O(1) time on average.

* **Space Complexity:** O(N*M) to store the `distance` array. The deque's size can also reach O(N*M) in the worst case, but this is dominated by the space used by the `distance` array.


In summary, the solution employs a modified Dijkstra's algorithm using a deque to efficiently find the minimum cost path through the grid, prioritizing moves with cost 0.  This leads to an optimal solution with a time and space complexity that's linear in the size of the grid.
