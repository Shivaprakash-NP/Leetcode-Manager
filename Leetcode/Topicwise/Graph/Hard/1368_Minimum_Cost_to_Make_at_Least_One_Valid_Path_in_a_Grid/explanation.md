## Minimum Cost to Make at Least One Valid Path in a Grid: Detailed Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the minimum cost to reach the bottom-right cell (n-1, m-1) of a grid from the top-left cell (0, 0).  Each cell in the grid contains a direction (1, 2, 3, or 4 representing right, left, down, up respectively).  Moving in the direction specified by the cell has a cost of 0, while moving in any other direction has a cost of 1. We need to find the path with the minimum total cost.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

This problem can be efficiently solved using Dijkstra's algorithm,  modified to prioritize movements in the suggested direction.  Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest paths from a single source node to all other nodes in a graph.  In this case, our graph is the grid, and the edges represent movements between adjacent cells with associated costs.  We use a deque (double-ended queue) to maintain the priority queue; this allows us to add nodes with cost 0 (following the suggested direction) to the front, ensuring they're processed first, mimicking Dijkstra's behavior while leveraging the speed of a deque.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * `int[][] grid`:  Represents the input grid, where each cell contains a direction.
    * `int[][] distance`: A 2D array to store the minimum distance from the source (0,0) to each cell. Initialized with `Integer.MAX_VALUE` to represent infinity.
    * `Deque<int[]> q`: A deque (double-ended queue) used as a priority queue to store cells to be visited, ordered by their distances from the source.  Elements are stored as `[distance, row, column]`.
    * `int[][] dir`: A 2D array representing the four possible movement directions (up, down, left, right).
    * `int[][] map`: A mapping array to quickly determine the coordinates change corresponding to the direction in each cell of `grid`.

* **Algorithms:**
    * **Dijkstra's Algorithm (modified):**  A shortest path algorithm adapted to prioritize movements in the suggested direction using a deque for the priority queue.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **Initialization:**
    * `n`, `m`: Store the dimensions of the grid.
    * `map`: Maps direction integers (1-4) to coordinate changes.  `map[1] = {0,1}` means direction 1 (right) results in +1 change in the column.
    * `distance`: Initialized with `Integer.MAX_VALUE` to track minimum distances.
    * `q`: The deque is initialized with the starting cell (0,0) with a distance of 0.
    * `dir`:  Defines the four possible movement directions.

* **Main Loop (while(!q.isEmpty())):**
    * `p = q.poll()`: Retrieves the cell with the minimum distance from the deque.
    * `i`, `j`, `dis`: Extract the row, column, and distance from `p`.
    * `cdir`: Gets the suggested direction from the `grid` at the current cell.

* **Exploring Neighbors:**
    * Iterates through the `dir` array to explore adjacent cells.
    * `ni`, `nj`: Calculate the coordinates of the neighbor.
    * **Boundary Check:** Ensures the neighbor is within the grid boundaries.
    * **Cost Calculation:** `c` is 0 if the move follows the suggested direction (`cdir`), otherwise it's 1.
    * **Distance Update:** If the new distance (`dis + c`) to the neighbor is less than the current minimum distance (`distance[ni][nj]`), the distance is updated.
    * **Queue Update:** The neighbor is added to the deque:  at the front if `c == 0` (following the direction) and at the end otherwise (not following the direction).

* **Result:**
    * `return distance[n-1][m-1]`: Returns the minimum distance to reach the bottom-right cell.

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(N*M), where N and M are the dimensions of the grid.  In the worst case, we might visit each cell once. The deque operations (addFirst, addLast, poll) take constant time on average.

* **Space Complexity:** O(N*M), primarily due to the `distance` array and the deque `q`.  In the worst-case scenario, the deque could hold all the cells in the grid.


This optimized Dijkstra's approach efficiently solves the problem by leveraging the deque for prioritized exploration, resulting in a time-efficient solution. The space complexity is linear with respect to the input size, which is acceptable for this type of problem.
