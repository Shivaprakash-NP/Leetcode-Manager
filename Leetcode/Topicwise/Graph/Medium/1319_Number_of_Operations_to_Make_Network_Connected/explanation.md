## LeetCode: Number of Operations to Make Network Connected - Solution Explained

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to determine the minimum number of cables needed to connect all computers in a network. We are given the number of computers (`n`) and a list of existing connections (`connections`).  Each connection is represented as an edge between two computers. The goal is to find the minimum number of additional cables required to make all computers connected (i.e., to form a single connected component). If it's impossible to connect all computers, the function should return -1.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

This problem can be efficiently solved using the Union-Find algorithm (also known as Disjoint-Set Union).  The intuition is as follows:

* **Union-Find's Role:**  Union-Find is perfect for tracking connected components.  We start by assuming each computer is its own connected component.  Then, for each connection in the input, we use the `union` function to merge the components of the connected computers.
* **Counting Components:** The number of connected components remaining after processing all existing connections represents the minimum number of additional cables needed. Each additional cable can connect two components, reducing the total number of components by one.
* **Edge Case:** If the number of existing connections is less than `n - 1`, it's impossible to connect all `n` computers, so we return -1.  A connected graph with `n` nodes requires at least `n - 1` edges.

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * `parent[]`: An integer array used in the Union-Find algorithm. `parent[i]` stores the parent node of node `i` in the disjoint-set forest.
    * `size[]`: An integer array used to optimize the union operation by performing union by size (or union by rank). `size[i]` stores the size of the tree rooted at node `i`.

* **Algorithms:**
    * **Union-Find (Disjoint-Set Union):**  This algorithm efficiently manages disjoint sets and performs union and find operations. Union by size (used here) improves performance.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **`makeConnected(int n, int[][] connections)`:** This is the main function.
    * **`if(n-1 > connections.length) return -1;`:** This line checks for the edge case where there aren't enough connections to form a connected graph.
    * **Initialization:** The `parent` and `size` arrays are initialized. Each node initially points to itself (`parent[i] = i`), and its size is 1 (`size[i] = 1`).
    * **Iteration:** The code iterates through each connection in `connections`.
    * **`union(u, v)`:**  For each connection (`u`, `v`), the `union` function is called to merge the components if they are not already connected. If a union happens, the `ans` (number of components) is decremented.
    * **Return Value:** Finally, `ans - 1` is returned. We subtract 1 because `ans` represents the number of connected components *after* processing all existing connections; we need one fewer cable than the number of components to fully connect the network.


* **`find(int u)`:** This function performs path compression to find the root (representative) of the set containing node `u`.

* **`union(int a, int b)`:** This function merges the sets containing nodes `a` and `b`. It uses union by size for efficiency.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(N*α(N)), where N is the number of computers and α(N) is the inverse Ackermann function, which is a very slow-growing function.  In practice, α(N) is considered a constant, so the time complexity is effectively linear, O(N). The Union-Find operations with path compression and union by size have an amortized time complexity of nearly O(1) per operation.

* **Space Complexity:** O(N), due to the `parent` and `size` arrays of size N.


In summary, the provided Java code uses an efficient Union-Find algorithm to solve the "Number of Operations to Make Network Connected" problem.  The solution is concise, correct, and has a near-linear time complexity, making it well-suited for the problem's constraints.
