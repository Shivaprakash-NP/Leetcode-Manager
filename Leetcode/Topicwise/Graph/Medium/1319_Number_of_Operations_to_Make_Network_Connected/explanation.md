## LeetCode: Number of Operations to Make Network Connected - Solution Explained

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to determine the minimum number of cables needed to connect all `n` computers in a network, given a set of existing connections.  Each computer is represented by a node, and connections are represented as edges between nodes.  If it's impossible to connect all computers, we return -1.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

This problem can be efficiently solved using the Union-Find algorithm (also known as Disjoint-Set Union).  The core idea is to represent each computer as a node in a disjoint-set data structure.  Initially, each computer is in its own set.  We then iterate through the connections:  If two computers are already in the same set (connected), we ignore the connection. Otherwise, we use the `union` operation to merge their sets, effectively connecting them. Finally, the number of remaining sets (disjoint components) represents the minimum number of additional connections needed to fully connect the network. We subtract 1 because we are counting the number of components needed to connect to the already connected components and not the components themselves.

This approach is chosen because Union-Find provides an efficient way to track connected components and perform union operations with path compression and union by rank (size in this case) for optimal performance.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * `parent`: An integer array representing the parent node of each node in the Union-Find data structure.  `parent[i]` is the parent of node `i`. If `parent[i] == i`, then `i` is the root of its set.
    * `size`: An integer array representing the size of each set. `size[i]` is the number of nodes in the set rooted at `i`.
* **Algorithms:**
    * **Union-Find:** The core algorithm used to efficiently manage disjoint sets and determine connectivity.  This involves the `find` and `union` operations.
    * **Path Compression (in `find`):** Optimizes `find` by flattening the tree structure during the search.
    * **Union by Rank (Union by Size in this case):** Optimizes `union` by always attaching the smaller set to the larger one, keeping the tree structure relatively flat.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **`makeConnected(int n, int[][] connections)`:** This is the main function.
    * `if(n-1 > connections.length) return -1;`: This crucial line checks if there are enough connections to potentially connect all nodes. If there are fewer connections than `n-1` (the minimum number of edges needed for a connected graph), it's impossible to connect the network, so we return -1.
    * `parent = new int[n]; size = new int[n];`: Initializes the `parent` and `size` arrays.
    * `for(int i = 0; i<n; i++) { parent[i] = i; size[i] = 1; }`: Initializes each node as its own parent (representing a separate set) with size 1.
    * `int ans = n;`: Initializes the count of disjoint sets to `n` (initially, each node is in its own set).
    * `for(int[] c : connections) { ... }`: Iterates through each connection.
        * `u = c[0]; v = c[1];`: Extracts the nodes connected by the current edge.
        * `if(union(u, v)) ans--;`: Calls the `union` function. If the `union` operation successfully merges two sets, it reduces the number of disjoint sets (`ans`).
    * `return ans-1;`: Returns the number of disjoint sets minus 1 (components to connect). This is the minimum number of additional edges needed.

* **`find(int u)`:** This function finds the root of the set containing node `u` using path compression.

* **`union(int a, int b)`:** This function merges the sets containing nodes `a` and `b` using union by size.  It returns `true` if the sets were successfully merged, `false` otherwise.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(Mα(N)), where N is the number of nodes (computers), M is the number of edges (connections), and α(N) is the inverse Ackermann function, which is practically a constant for all practical input sizes.  The dominant operation is the Union-Find operations, which are amortized O(α(N)) per operation due to path compression and union by rank (size).

* **Space Complexity:** O(N) to store the `parent` and `size` arrays.  This is linear with respect to the number of nodes.

The Union-Find algorithm's efficiency, particularly with path compression and union by size, makes this solution highly scalable for large networks.
