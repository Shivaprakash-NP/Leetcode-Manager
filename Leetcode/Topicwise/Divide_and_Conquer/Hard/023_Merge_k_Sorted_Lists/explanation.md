## LeetCode: Merge k Sorted Lists - Detailed Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to merge `k` sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list.  We are given an array of `ListNode` objects, where each `ListNode` represents the head of a sorted linked list. The goal is to efficiently combine these lists into one resulting sorted linked list.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The most efficient approach for this problem uses a priority queue (min-heap).  A priority queue allows us to efficiently find the smallest element among all the `k` lists.  We iterate through the lists, adding the head node of each to the priority queue.  Then, repeatedly, we extract the smallest node from the queue, add it to the result list, and add the next node from the same list back into the queue.  This process continues until the queue is empty. This approach is chosen because it provides a logarithmic time complexity for finding the minimum element compared to a linear scan which would be inefficient with k lists.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * `ListNode`: A singly linked list node.  This is a standard data structure used to represent linked lists.
    * `PriorityQueue<ListNode>`: A priority queue (min-heap) that stores `ListNode` objects, ordered by their `val` (value) field.  This is crucial for efficiently finding the smallest node across all lists.

* **Algorithms:**
    * **Priority Queue Operations:** `offer()` (insertion), `poll()` (extraction of the minimum element).
    * **Linked List Traversal:** Iterating through the linked lists to build the merged list.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode mergeKLists(ListNode[] lists) {
        if (lists == null || lists.length == 0) return null; // Handle empty input

        PriorityQueue<ListNode> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> a.val - b.val); // Initialize min-heap

        for (ListNode node : lists) { // Add the head of each list to the priority queue
            if (node != null) pq.offer(node);
        }

        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0); // Dummy node to simplify the result list construction
        ListNode current = dummy; // Pointer to the tail of the result list

        while (!pq.isEmpty()) { // Continue until all nodes are processed
            ListNode smallest = pq.poll(); // Get the smallest node
            current.next = smallest; // Add it to the result list
            current = current.next; // Move the tail pointer

            if (smallest.next != null) pq.offer(smallest.next); // Add the next node from the same list
        }

        return dummy.next; // Return the head of the merged list (skip the dummy node)
    }
}
```

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(N log k), where N is the total number of nodes across all k lists, and k is the number of lists.  Inserting and extracting from the priority queue takes O(log k) time.  We perform these operations N times.

* **Space Complexity:** O(k). The space is dominated by the priority queue, which at most holds k elements (one from each list).  In the worst case, all the heads are present in the queue at the same time. The space used by the `ListNode` itself is O(N).


**In Summary:**

This solution efficiently merges k sorted linked lists using a priority queue.  The use of a min-heap ensures that we always find the smallest element quickly, leading to an optimal time complexity. The space complexity is linear with the number of input lists, which is acceptable given the problem constraints.  The use of a dummy node elegantly simplifies the process of constructing the merged linked list.
