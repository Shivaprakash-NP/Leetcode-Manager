## Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and Postorder Traversal: A Detailed Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to construct a binary tree given its inorder and postorder traversal sequences.  The inorder traversal visits nodes in the order left-subtree, root, right-subtree. The postorder traversal visits nodes in the order left-subtree, right-subtree, root.  We need to reconstruct the tree's structure using only this information.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

This solution employs a recursive approach based on the properties of inorder and postorder traversals.  The key idea is that the last element in the postorder traversal is always the root of the entire tree.  Using the root's value, we can find its position in the inorder traversal.  This position divides the inorder traversal into the left and right subtrees.  Correspondingly, we can also divide the postorder traversal into segments representing the left and right subtrees.  We recursively apply this process to the sub-arrays until we reach the base case (empty sub-arrays).  A HashMap is used to efficiently locate the index of a node's value in the inorder array.  This avoids repeated linear searches, significantly improving efficiency.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * `TreeNode`: A standard node structure for a binary tree.
    * `HashMap<Integer, Integer>`: Used to store the inorder values and their indices for fast lookups.
* **Algorithms:**
    * **Recursion:** The core algorithm uses recursion to break down the problem into smaller subproblems.
    * **Divide and Conquer:** The problem is divided into subproblems based on the root's position in the inorder traversal.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **`TreeNode` Class:** This is a standard definition for a node in a binary tree, which is provided in the problem statement.

* **`build(int[] po, int ps, int pe, int[] io, int is, int ie, Map<Integer, Integer> map)`:** This is a recursive helper function that does the actual tree construction.
    * `po`, `ps`, `pe`: Postorder array, start index, end index.
    * `io`, `is`, `ie`: Inorder array, start index, end index.
    * `map`: HashMap mapping inorder values to their indices.

    * **Base Case:** `if(ps > pe || is > ie) return null;` - If the postorder or inorder sub-array is empty, we return `null`.

    * **Root Node Creation:** `TreeNode root = new TreeNode(po[pe]);` - The last element of the postorder sub-array is the root of the current subtree.

    * **Finding Root in Inorder:** `int ir = map.get(root.val);` -  We find the index (`ir`) of the root's value in the inorder array using the HashMap for O(1) lookup.

    * **Calculating Left Subtree Size:** `int nleft = ir - is;` - The number of elements to the left of the root in the inorder array represents the size of the left subtree.

    * **Recursive Calls:**
        * `root.left = build(po, ps, ps + nleft - 1, io, is, ir - 1, map);` - Recursively build the left subtree using the corresponding portions of the postorder and inorder arrays.
        * `root.right = build(po, ps + nleft, pe - 1, io, ir + 1, ie, map);` - Recursively build the right subtree.

    * **Return:** `return root;` - Returns the constructed subtree rooted at `root`.

* **`buildTree(int[] inorder, int[] postorder)`:** This is the main function.
    * **HashMap Creation:** `Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();` - A HashMap is created to store inorder values and their indices.
    * **Populating HashMap:** The loop populates the HashMap with inorder values and their indices.
    * **Recursive Call:** `return build(postorder, 0, postorder.length - 1, inorder, 0, inorder.length - 1, map);` - Calls the recursive helper function to build the tree.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.  Each node is visited and processed exactly once during the recursive calls.  The HashMap lookups are O(1) on average.

* **Space Complexity:** O(N) in the worst case. This is primarily due to the recursive call stack, which can reach a depth of N in a skewed tree. The HashMap also uses O(N) space.  In a balanced tree, the space complexity would be O(log N) due to the recursive call stack.

In summary, this solution efficiently reconstructs the binary tree using a divide-and-conquer recursive approach and a HashMap for optimized lookups.  The time and space complexity are both linear in the number of nodes, making it an efficient algorithm for this problem.
