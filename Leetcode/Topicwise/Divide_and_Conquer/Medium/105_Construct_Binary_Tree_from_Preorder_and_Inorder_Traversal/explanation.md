## Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal: A Detailed Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to construct a binary tree given two arrays: a preorder traversal (`preorder`) and an inorder traversal (`inorder`) of the tree.  The preorder traversal lists nodes in the order they are visited during a depth-first search (root, left, right), while the inorder traversal lists nodes in the order (left, root, right).  We need to use this information to reconstruct the unique binary tree.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution uses a recursive approach based on the properties of preorder and inorder traversals.  The core idea is this:

* **Preorder's first element is always the root:** The first element in the `preorder` array is the root node of the tree.
* **Inorder splits the tree:**  The root node in the `inorder` array separates the left subtree from the right subtree.  All elements to the left of the root in `inorder` belong to the left subtree, and all elements to the right belong to the right subtree.
* **Recursive construction:** We recursively build the left and right subtrees using the same logic. We determine the size of the left subtree using the index of the root in the inorder traversal.  This size helps us partition the preorder array accordingly for recursive calls.

This approach is chosen because it directly leverages the inherent information present in the preorder and inorder traversals to efficiently reconstruct the tree.  Other approaches might exist, but this is an elegant and commonly used solution with good efficiency.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * `TreeNode`: A custom class representing a node in the binary tree.
    * `HashMap<Integer, Integer>`: Used to store the inorder traversal values and their indices for efficient lookup (O(1) average-case).  This speeds up finding the root's index in the `inorder` array.
* **Algorithms:**
    * **Recursion:** The core algorithm uses recursion to build the tree level by level.
    * **Divide and Conquer:**  The problem is broken down into smaller subproblems (constructing left and right subtrees) which are solved recursively.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **`TreeNode` class:** This is a standard definition for a binary tree node, containing the node's value (`val`) and references to its left (`left`) and right (`right`) children.

* **`buildTree(int[] preorder, int[] inorder)`:** This is the main function.
    * It initializes a `HashMap` called `map` to store the values of `inorder` array and their indices for fast lookups.
    * It calls the recursive helper function `build` to construct the tree.

* **`build(int[] po, int ps, int pe, int[] io, int is, int ie, Map<Integer, Integer> map)`:** This is the recursive helper function.
    * `po`, `io`: preorder and inorder arrays.
    * `ps`, `pe`: start and end indices of the preorder subarray to process.
    * `is`, `ie`: start and end indices of the inorder subarray to process.
    * `map`: The HashMap created in `buildTree`.

    * **Base Case:**  If `ps > pe` or `is > ie`, it means we've processed an empty subarray, so it returns `null`.
    * **Root Node Creation:** It creates a new `TreeNode` with the value at `po[ps]` (the first element of the current preorder subarray, which is the root).
    * **Finding Root Index in Inorder:**  It uses the `map` to find the index (`ir`) of the root node's value in the inorder array.
    * **Calculating Left Subtree Size:** It calculates the number of nodes (`nleft`) in the left subtree using `ir - is`.
    * **Recursive Calls:** It recursively calls `build` to construct the left and right subtrees using appropriate subarrays from `preorder` and `inorder`.  The indices are carefully adjusted to reflect the partitioning based on `nleft` and `ir`.
    * **Return Value:** It returns the constructed `root` node.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.  Each node is visited and processed exactly once during the construction. The HashMap lookup takes O(1) on average.

* **Space Complexity:** O(N) in the worst case. This is due to the recursive call stack, which can grow to a depth of N in a skewed tree. Additionally, the HashMap uses O(N) space to store the inorder array's indices.  In the best-case scenario (a balanced tree), the space complexity of the recursive stack will be O(log N).

In summary, this solution efficiently constructs the binary tree using a recursive approach that leverages the properties of preorder and inorder traversals.  The use of a HashMap significantly optimizes the search for node indices in the inorder array.  The time complexity is linear, and the space complexity is linear in the worst case due to the recursive call stack and the HashMap.
