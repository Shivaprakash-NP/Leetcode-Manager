## Maximum Subarray Problem Explanation

Here's a detailed explanation of the provided Java code for the LeetCode "Maximum Subarray" problem, covering problem understanding, approach, data structures, code walkthrough, and complexity analysis.

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The "Maximum Subarray" problem asks us to find the contiguous subarray within a given array of integers that has the largest sum. We need to return this maximum sum.  For example, given the array `[-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]`, the maximum subarray is `[4, -1, 2, 1]`, and its sum is 6.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The provided code uses Kadane's Algorithm, which is a dynamic programming approach. The core idea behind Kadane's Algorithm is:

*   **Maintain a "current sum" (`cs`)**: This variable keeps track of the sum of the current subarray being considered.
*   **Update the "maximum sum" (`max`)**: This variable stores the largest sum found so far.
*   **Reset the "current sum" if it becomes negative**:  If the current sum becomes negative, it means that including the current subarray in any future subarray will only *decrease* the sum. Therefore, it's better to start a new subarray from the next element.

**Why Kadane's Algorithm?**

Kadane's Algorithm provides an efficient way to solve this problem in linear time (O(n)).  It avoids the need to check all possible subarrays, which would result in a much slower solution (O(n^2) or O(n^3)). The algorithm smartly leverages the fact that a negative subarray sum will always be detrimental to finding the maximum sum. By resetting the `cs` to 0 when it drops below zero, we are essentially discarding portions of the input array that are guaranteed to not contribute to a larger overall result.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   The code primarily works directly on the input `int[] nums` array.  No other significant data structures are used.

*   **Algorithms:**
    *   **Kadane's Algorithm:**  This is the core algorithm used to efficiently find the maximum subarray sum. It relies on dynamic programming principles.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {
        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE; // Initialize max to the smallest possible integer value
        int cs = 0; // Initialize current sum to 0

        for(int v : nums) // Iterate through each element of the array
        {
            cs += v; // Add the current element to the current sum
            max = Math.max(max , cs); // Update max with the larger of max and current sum
            if(cs < 0) cs = 0; // If current sum is negative, reset it to 0
        }

        return max; // Return the maximum subarray sum
    }
}
```

1.  **`int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;`**: Initializes `max` to the smallest possible integer value. This is important because we want to find the *maximum* sum, and starting with a very small value ensures that any positive or even small negative sum will be larger.

2.  **`int cs = 0;`**: Initializes `cs` (current sum) to 0.  This variable will track the sum of the current subarray being considered.

3.  **`for(int v : nums)`**: This loop iterates through each element (`v`) in the input array `nums`. This is a enhanced for loop, providing a clean way to step through the elements.

4.  **`cs += v;`**:  Adds the current element `v` to the `cs`. This updates the current sum.

5.  **`max = Math.max(max , cs);`**: This line is crucial.  It updates the `max` variable with the larger value between the current `max` and the current `cs`. This ensures that `max` always holds the largest subarray sum encountered so far.

6.  **`if(cs < 0) cs = 0;`**: This is the core logic of Kadane's Algorithm. If the `cs` becomes negative, it means that including the current subarray in any future subarray is detrimental to finding the maximum sum. Therefore, we reset `cs` to 0, effectively starting a new subarray from the next element.

7.  **`return max;`**: After iterating through all the elements, the `max` variable holds the maximum subarray sum, which is returned.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n) - The code iterates through the input array `nums` once in a single `for` loop. Therefore, the time complexity is directly proportional to the size of the input array, making it linear.

*   **Space Complexity:** O(1) - The code uses only a few constant extra variables (`max`, `cs`).  The amount of memory used does not depend on the size of the input array.  Therefore, the space complexity is constant.
