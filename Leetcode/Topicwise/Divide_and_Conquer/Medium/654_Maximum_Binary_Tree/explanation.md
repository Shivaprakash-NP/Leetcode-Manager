## Maximum Binary Tree - Detailed Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The "Maximum Binary Tree" problem asks us to construct a binary tree from a given integer array `nums` where the tree follows these rules:

1.  The root is the maximum value in the array `nums`.
2.  The left subtree is the maximum tree constructed from the subarray to the left of the root's value.
3.  The right subtree is the maximum tree constructed from the subarray to the right of the root's value.

We need to return the root of this constructed binary tree.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The problem lends itself nicely to a recursive solution. The core idea is to:

1.  **Find the maximum element:** In the given range of the array, find the largest element and its index. This will be the root of our current subtree.
2.  **Create the root node:** Create a `TreeNode` with the maximum element's value.
3.  **Recursive construction:** Recursively call the same function on the subarrays to the left and right of the maximum element's index.  The left recursive call will build the left subtree, and the right recursive call will build the right subtree.
4.  **Connect the subtrees:** Connect the left and right subtrees to the root node.
5.  **Base Cases:** Handle the base cases for recursion:
    *   If the range is invalid (left index > right index), it means the subarray is empty, so return `null`.
    *   If the range contains only one element (left index == right index), create a `TreeNode` with that single element and return it.

This approach works because it mirrors the problem's recursive definition.  Each recursive call constructs the maximum binary tree for a sub-array, ensuring the overall tree structure adheres to the problem's rules.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structure:** Binary Tree (represented using `TreeNode` class)
*   **Algorithm:** Recursion (specifically, Divide and Conquer)

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }

class Solution {
    private TreeNode build(int[] arr, int l, int r) {
        if(l > r) return null; // Base Case 1: Empty subarray

        if(l == r) return new TreeNode(arr[l]); // Base Case 2: Single element subarray

        int max = -1;
        int maxi = -1;

        for(int i = l; i<=r; i++) { // Find the maximum element and its index
            if(arr[i] > max) {
                max = arr[i];
                maxi = i;
            }
        }

        if(maxi == -1) return null; // Should never happen given the problem constraints but a good defensive check

        TreeNode node = new TreeNode(arr[maxi]); // Create the root node
        node.left = build(arr, l, maxi-1); // Recursively build the left subtree
        node.right = build(arr, maxi+1, r); // Recursively build the right subtree

        return node; // Return the root node of the constructed subtree
    }

    public TreeNode constructMaximumBinaryTree(int[] nums) {
        return build(nums, 0, nums.length-1); // Initiate the recursive process with the entire array
    }
}
```

*   **`TreeNode` Class:**  Defines the structure of a node in the binary tree, with `val`, `left`, and `right` attributes.

*   **`build(int[] arr, int l, int r)` function:** This is the recursive function.
    *   **`if(l > r) return null;`**:  Base case. If the left index `l` is greater than the right index `r`, it means we're dealing with an empty subarray. We return `null` to indicate an empty subtree.
    *   **`if(l == r) return new TreeNode(arr[l]);`**: Base case. If the left and right indices are equal, it means we have a single element in the subarray.  We create a `TreeNode` with that element's value and return it.
    *   **`int max = -1; int maxi = -1;`**: Initialize `max` to track the maximum value encountered so far, and `maxi` to track the index of that maximum value.
    *   **`for(int i = l; i<=r; i++) { ... }`**: This loop iterates through the subarray from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) to find the maximum element and its index.
    *   **`if(arr[i] > max) { ... }`**:  Inside the loop, we update `max` and `maxi` whenever we encounter a larger element.
    *   **`TreeNode node = new TreeNode(arr[maxi]);`**: After the loop, we create a new `TreeNode` with the maximum element's value (`arr[maxi]`).  This is the root of the subtree we are currently building.
    *   **`node.left = build(arr, l, maxi-1);`**:  We recursively call the `build` function to construct the left subtree. The left subtree will be built from the subarray to the left of the maximum element (from index `l` to `maxi-1`).
    *   **`node.right = build(arr, maxi+1, r);`**:  We recursively call the `build` function to construct the right subtree. The right subtree will be built from the subarray to the right of the maximum element (from index `maxi+1` to `r`).
    *   **`return node;`**: We return the root node of the constructed subtree.

*   **`constructMaximumBinaryTree(int[] nums)` function:** This is the main function that is called initially.  It simply calls the `build` function with the entire input array (`nums`) and returns the root of the constructed maximum binary tree.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(N<sup>2</sup>), where N is the length of the input array `nums`.

    *   The `constructMaximumBinaryTree` function calls the `build` function once.
    *   The `build` function has a loop that iterates through a portion of the array to find the maximum element. In the worst case (e.g., the array is sorted in ascending order), the loop iterates through the entire subarray in each recursive call.
    *   The height of the tree can be N in the worst case (e.g., sorted array), leading to N recursive calls.
    *   Therefore, the time complexity is roughly proportional to the sum of the lengths of the subarrays processed at each level of recursion.  This simplifies to O(N<sup>2</sup>).

*   **Space Complexity:** O(N), where N is the length of the input array `nums`.

    *   The space complexity comes from two sources:
        *   **Recursion Stack:** In the worst case, the recursion depth can be N (e.g., a skewed tree), leading to O(N) space used by the call stack.
        *   **Output Tree:** The maximum binary tree itself requires O(N) space to store its nodes.
    *   The space occupied by the `nums` array is not counted as auxiliary space.
