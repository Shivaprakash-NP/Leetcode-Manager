## LeetCode Problem: Find the Minimum Amount of Time to Brew Potions - Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to find the minimum amount of time required to brew `n` potions.  We are given two arrays: `skill` and `mana`. `skill[i]` represents the skill level required to brew the `i`-th potion. `mana[j]` represents the mana available for use in the `j`-th brewing cycle. We can brew any potion in any order during a brewing cycle. The time to brew potion `i` using mana `j` is `mana[j] * skill[i]`.  The crucial constraint is that within each brewing cycle (determined by the `mana` array), we must brew the potions in a specific, dependent way. Each potion must be brewed *after* the previous potion and *before* the next potion in a loop.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is to model the dependencies between potions within each mana cycle using dynamic programming. We maintain an array `done` where `done[i]` represents the minimum time taken to brew potions 0 to `i-1`  *considering all previous mana cycles*.  The key to this is the observation that the potions must be brewed in order (though this ordering is not constant throughout the process).

The outer loop iterates through each `mana[j]` representing a brewing cycle. The inner loops then perform two crucial updates:

*   **Forward Loop:** For each `mana[j]`, the first inner loop calculates the minimum time to reach `done[i+1]`.  Since `done[i+1]` means having brewed potions from 0 to `i`, it depends on the previous potions (0 to `i-1`). We take the maximum of the current `done[i+1]` and the time taken to brew potions up to `i` plus the time to brew potion `i` using `mana[j]`. This ensures we always have the *minimum* time to reach this state, considering all previous cycles. `done[i + 1] = Math.max(done[i + 1], done[i]) + (long) mana[j] * skill[i];`

*   **Backward Loop:** After the forward loop calculates the brewing times assuming we always progress forward from the start of the array, this loop compensates for the looping nature of the potion dependency. By ensuring that we can also come from the higher-indexed potion, we guarantee optimality. `done[i] = done[i + 1] - (long) mana[j] * skill[i];` This essentially means, the time to arrive at `done[i]` is equivalent to the time at `done[i + 1]` minus the time taken to brew potion `i` with `mana[j]`.

The algorithm chooses this approach because it efficiently propagates the information about the minimum time taken to brew potions, while respecting the constraints on the dependencies within each cycle. The dynamic programming approach combined with the forward and backward loops strategically handles the loop dependency of potions.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structure:** `long[] done`: A 1D array to store the minimum time taken to brew potions up to a certain index.
*   **Algorithm:** Dynamic Programming. The code uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the minimum time. The core idea is to store the intermediate results in the `done` array. The two loops calculate and update the `done` array, ensuring we consider all possible brewing orders based on the problem's constraints.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public long minTime(int[] skill, int[] mana) {
        int n = skill.length, m = mana.length;
        long[] done = new long[n + 1]; // Initialize an array to store minimum times. done[i] represents time to brew potions 0 to i-1

        for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j) { // Iterate through each mana cycle
            for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) { // Forward loop: Calculate time to brew potions up to index i
                done[i + 1] = Math.max(done[i + 1], done[i]) + (long) mana[j] * skill[i];
                // done[i+1]: Minimum time to brew potions 0 to i
                // Math.max(done[i + 1], done[i]): Either the previous minimum time for potions 0 to i, or the time to brew potion 0 to i-1
                // + (long) mana[j] * skill[i]: Add the time to brew potion i using mana[j]
            }
            for (int i = n - 1; i > 0; --i) {
                done[i] = done[i + 1] - (long) mana[j] * skill[i];
            }
        }

        return done[n]; // Return the minimum time taken to brew all n potions
    }
}
```

*   **Initialization:** `int n = skill.length, m = mana.length;`: Stores the number of potions and mana cycles. `long[] done = new long[n + 1];`: Creates an array `done` of size `n+1`. `done[i]` will store the minimum time to brew the first `i` potions.
*   **Outer Loop:** `for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j)`: Iterates through each available mana. This represents a brewing cycle.
*   **Forward Inner Loop:** `for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)`: This loop calculates the minimum time to brew potion `i` using mana `j`. It builds up the `done` array from left to right, ensuring that the time to brew potions 0 to `i` is minimized. `done[i+1] = Math.max(done[i+1], done[i]) + (long) mana[j] * skill[i];` means the time to brew until potion i is maximum of the time required till i as it is or the time till i-1 (done[i]) plus the time to brew potion i with current mana. We take the `Math.max()` because we want the minimum time.
*   **Backward Inner Loop:** `for (int i = n - 1; i > 0; --i)`: This second loop further optimizes by considering the looped dependency. `done[i] = done[i + 1] - (long) mana[j] * skill[i];` calculates the time needed to complete brewing up to `i` using the previously calculated brewing up to `i+1`. The algorithm implicitly loops between the last and first potions.
*   **Return:** `return done[n];`: Returns the value in `done[n]`, which represents the minimum time to brew all potions.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n * m), where `n` is the number of potions (`skill.length`) and `m` is the number of mana cycles (`mana.length`).  The nested loops iterate through all potions for each mana cycle.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the number of potions. This is due to the `done` array which has a length of `n+1`.
