## Spiral Matrix II Explained

This document provides a comprehensive explanation of the provided Java code for generating a spiral matrix.

### 1. Problem Understanding

The "Spiral Matrix II" problem asks us to generate an `n x n` square matrix filled with elements from 1 to `n^2` in spiral order. This means we need to fill the matrix layer by layer, starting from the outermost layer and moving inwards, filling each layer in a clockwise spiral.

### 2. Approach / Intuition

The approach used is to simulate the spiral traversal directly. We define four boundary pointers: `l` (left), `r` (right), `t` (top), and `b` (bottom).  These pointers represent the current boundaries of the matrix layer we are filling. We iterate filling the top row from left to right, then the right column from top to bottom, then the bottom row from right to left, and finally the left column from bottom to top. After each layer is filled, we shrink the boundaries by moving the pointers inwards.

The `while` loop continues as long as the left boundary is less than or equal to the right boundary, and the top boundary is less than or equal to the bottom boundary. Within the `while` loop, we have four `for` loops, each responsible for filling one side of the current layer.

This approach is chosen because it directly mimics the spiral traversal process, making it relatively straightforward to implement and understand.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms

*   **Data Structure:** A 2D integer array (matrix) is the primary data structure used to store the generated spiral matrix.
*   **Algorithm:** The algorithm is based on iterative traversal with boundary management. It involves shrinking the boundaries of the matrix after each layer is filled. There are no complex algorithms used here. Just controlled iteration.

### 4. Code Walkthrough

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] generateMatrix(int n) {
        // Initialize boundary pointers
        int l = 0; // Left boundary
        int r = n-1; // Right boundary
        int t = 0; // Top boundary
        int b = n-1; // Bottom boundary
        int val = 1; // Starting value to fill the matrix
        int[][] matrix = new int[n][n]; // Create the n x n matrix

        // Iterate until all layers are filled
        while(l<=r && t<=b)
        {
            // Fill top row (left to right)
            for(int i = l ; i<=r ; i++ , val++)
                matrix[t][i] = val;
            t++; // Move top boundary down

            // Fill right column (top to bottom)
            for(int i = t ; i<=b ; i++ , val++)
                matrix[i][r] = val;
            r--; // Move right boundary left

            // Fill bottom row (right to left) - Check if remaining rows
            if(t<=b)
            {
                for(int i = r ; i>=l ; i-- , val++)
                    matrix[b][i] = val;
                b--; // Move bottom boundary up
            }

            // Fill left column (bottom to top) - Check if remaining columns
            if(l<=r)
            {
                for(int i = b ; i>=t ; i-- , val++)
                    matrix[i][l] = val;
                l++; // Move left boundary right
            }
        }
        return matrix; // Return the generated spiral matrix
    }
}
```

*   **`int l = 0; int r = n-1; int t = 0; int b = n-1;`**:  Initializes the left, right, top, and bottom boundary pointers.  `l` and `t` start at 0, representing the top-left corner. `r` and `b` start at `n-1`, representing the bottom-right corner.
*   **`int val = 1;`**: Initializes the value to be filled in the matrix.
*   **`int[][] matrix = new int[n][n];`**: Creates the `n x n` matrix.
*   **`while(l<=r && t<=b)`**: This `while` loop is the main loop that continues as long as there are layers left to fill.  The condition `l <= r && t <= b` ensures that the inner area still has elements to be filled.
*   **`for(int i = l ; i<=r ; i++ , val++) matrix[t][i] = val;`**: Fills the top row of the current layer from left (`l`) to right (`r`). `val` is incremented in each iteration.  After filling, the top boundary (`t`) is incremented.
*   **`for(int i = t ; i<=b ; i++ , val++) matrix[i][r] = val;`**: Fills the right column of the current layer from top (`t`) to bottom (`b`). After filling, the right boundary (`r`) is decremented.
*   **`if(t<=b) { ... }`**: This `if` condition is important. After filling the top row and right column, we need to make sure there's still a bottom row to fill. Without this check, if `n` is odd and we're in the innermost loop, we would attempt to fill the same row twice. The `if` statement prevents overlapping fills by exiting the bottom row and left column filling when `t > b` has occurred (when inner dimensions are a single row or column.
*   **`for(int i = r ; i>=l ; i-- , val++) matrix[b][i] = val;`**: Fills the bottom row of the current layer from right (`r`) to left (`l`).  After filling, the bottom boundary (`b`) is decremented.
*   **`if(l<=r) { ... }`**: Similar to the `t <= b` check, this `if` condition ensures there's still a left column to fill. It's crucial to prevent overlapping fills when dealing with odd-sized matrices.
*   **`for(int i = b ; i>=t ; i-- , val++) matrix[i][l] = val;`**: Fills the left column of the current layer from bottom (`b`) to top (`t`). After filling, the left boundary (`l`) is incremented.
*   **`return matrix;`**: Returns the generated `n x n` spiral matrix.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity

*   **Time Complexity: O(n^2)**. The algorithm iterates through all `n*n` elements of the matrix exactly once to fill them. The number of operations is directly proportional to the square of `n`.
*   **Space Complexity: O(n^2)**. The space complexity is dominated by the size of the output matrix, which is `n x n`. Therefore, the space complexity is O(n^2). The boundary pointers and the `val` variable use constant extra space, which doesn't depend on `n`.
