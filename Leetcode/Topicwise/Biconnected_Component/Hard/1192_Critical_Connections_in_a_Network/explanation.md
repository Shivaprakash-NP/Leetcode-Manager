## LeetCode: Critical Connections in a Network - Detailed Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find all the "critical connections" in an undirected network represented as a list of edges. A critical connection is an edge whose removal would increase the number of connected components in the network.  In other words, it's an edge that, if removed, would disconnect two parts of the network that were previously connected.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

This solution uses Tarjan's algorithm, a powerful technique for finding articulation points and bridges in a graph.  A critical connection is essentially a bridge in an undirected graph.  Tarjan's algorithm efficiently identifies bridges by performing a Depth First Search (DFS) and tracking the discovery time (`time`) and the lowest reachable discovery time (`low`) for each node.

The core idea is that if the lowest reachable time (`low`) from a node's descendant is greater than the node's discovery time (`time`), then the edge connecting the node to that descendant is a critical connection (bridge).  This is because there's no other way to reach the descendant's subtree from an earlier point in the DFS traversal.

This approach is chosen because Tarjan's algorithm has a linear time complexity, making it efficient for large networks.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * `ArrayList<List<Integer>> ans`: Stores the list of critical connections (edges). Each inner list represents an edge with two nodes.
    * `int[] time`: Array to store the discovery time of each node during DFS.
    * `int[] low`: Array to store the lowest reachable discovery time from each node.
    * `ArrayList<Integer>[] adj`: Adjacency list representation of the graph, allowing efficient neighbor access.
* **Algorithms:**
    * **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Used to traverse the graph and find critical connections.
    * **Tarjan's Algorithm:**  The underlying algorithm to find bridges (critical connections) using DFS and tracking `time` and `low` values.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **`criticalConnections(int n, List<List<Integer>> connections)`:**
    * Initializes `time`, `low`, and `adj`.  `time` is filled with -1 (unvisited), `low` with Integer.MAX_VALUE.  `adj` creates the adjacency list from the input `connections`.
    * Calls `dfs(-1, 0)` to start the DFS from node 0 (arbitrary starting node).  -1 represents the parent node in the initial call.
    * Returns `ans`, the list of critical connections.

* **`dfs(int par, int node)`:**
    * Sets the discovery time `time[node]` and the lowest reachable time `low[node]` to the current DFS time `t`.
    * Iterates through the neighbors (`v`) of the current node `node`.
        * It skips the parent node (`par`) to avoid going back up the tree.
        * If a neighbor `v` is unvisited (`time[v] == -1`), recursively calls `dfs(node, v)` to explore that branch.
        * After returning from the recursive call, it updates `low[node]` to be the minimum of `low[v]` and `low[node]`.  This is crucial for finding the lowest reachable time.
        * If `low[v] > time[node]`, it means a bridge is found, so the edge (`node`, `v`) is added to `ans`.
        * If a neighbor `v` is visited (`time[v] != -1`), it updates `low[node]` with the minimum of `low[node]` and `time[v]`. This considers back edges and ensures the lowest reachable time is captured.

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices (nodes) and E is the number of edges in the graph.  This is because the DFS visits each vertex and edge exactly once.

* **Space Complexity:** O(V + E).  This is due to the space used by:
    * `time` and `low` arrays: O(V)
    * `adj` adjacency list: O(V + E) in the worst case (dense graph).
    * `ans` list of critical connections: O(E) in the worst case (all edges are critical).


In summary, this Java code provides an efficient and elegant solution to the "Critical Connections in a Network" problem using Tarjan's algorithm. The use of an adjacency list and the clear implementation of DFS with proper time and low value tracking makes this solution easy to understand and highly performant.
