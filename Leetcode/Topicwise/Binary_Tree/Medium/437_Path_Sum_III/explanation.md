## LeetCode: Path Sum III - Detailed Solution Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem "Path Sum III" asks us to find the number of paths in a binary tree where the sum of the node values along each path equals a given target sum.  Crucially, these paths don't need to start from the root node; they can begin at any node in the tree.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution employs a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach combined with a prefix sum technique.  A naive approach would be to explore all possible paths from every node, leading to exponential time complexity.  This solution optimizes by using a `HashMap` to efficiently track prefix sums encountered along each path.

Instead of exploring every path independently, we track the cumulative sum (`sum`) as we traverse the tree. For each node, we check if there exists a prefix sum that, when added to the current node's value, results in the target sum. This is efficiently done using the `HashMap` which stores prefix sums and their frequencies.  The `HashMap` `psum` acts as a cache to avoid redundant computations.

The post-order processing in the DFS (decrementing the prefix sum count after the recursive call) ensures that each prefix sum's count is accurately reflected for subsequent paths.  This is crucial to avoid overcounting paths.

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * `TreeNode`:  Represents a node in the binary tree.
    * `HashMap<Long, Integer> psum`: Stores prefix sums encountered during the traversal and their frequencies.  `Long` is used to handle potential integer overflow.
* **Algorithms:**
    * Depth-First Search (DFS): To systematically explore all paths in the binary tree.
    * Prefix Sum: To efficiently track and check for paths with the target sum.

**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **`TreeNode` Class:** This is a standard definition for a node in a binary tree, provided by LeetCode.

* **`Solution` Class:**
    * `ans`: An integer variable to store the final count of paths with the target sum. Initialized to 0.
    * `dfs(TreeNode node, long sum, long t, Map<Long, Integer> psum)`: This is the recursive DFS function.
        * **Base Case:** If `node` is null, it returns.
        * **Prefix Sum Update:** It adds the current node's value to the `sum`.
        * **Path Count Update:** It checks if `sum - t` exists as a key in `psum`. If it does, it means a path with the target sum (`t`) has been found, starting from a previous node. The frequency of that prefix sum (`psum.getOrDefault(sum - t, 0)`) is added to `ans`.
        * **Prefix Sum Storage:** It updates the frequency of the current `sum` in `psum`.
        * **Recursive Calls:** It recursively calls `dfs` for the left and right children.
        * **Backtracking:** After processing the left and right children, it decrements the frequency of the current `sum` in `psum`. This is crucial for backtracking â€“ removing the effect of the current node from the prefix sum count.  This prevents overcounting paths that share prefixes.
    * `pathSum(TreeNode root, int targetSum)`: This is the main function.
        * It initializes a `HashMap` `psum` with a count of 1 for a prefix sum of 0. This handles cases where paths start from the root and sum to `targetSum`.
        * It calls the `dfs` function to start the traversal from the root.
        * Finally, it returns `ans`, which holds the total count of paths.

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree.  Each node is visited exactly once during the DFS traversal. The HashMap operations (get and put) take constant time on average.

* **Space Complexity:** O(H), where H is the height of the binary tree. This is due to the recursive call stack of the DFS, which can go as deep as the height of the tree.  In the worst-case (a skewed tree), H can be equal to N. The space used by the `HashMap` `psum` can also be at most O(N) in the worst-case, where all nodes form a path, but this is still dominated by the recursive call stack's space in a skewed tree.  For balanced trees, H is O(log N). Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(H) or O(N) in the worst case.


This solution provides an efficient way to solve the Path Sum III problem by cleverly utilizing a prefix sum approach and a HashMap to avoid redundant calculations.  The backtracking step using post-order processing in the DFS is essential for correctness.
