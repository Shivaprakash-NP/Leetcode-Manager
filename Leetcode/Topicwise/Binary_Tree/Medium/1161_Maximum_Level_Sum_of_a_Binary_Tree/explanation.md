## LeetCode: Maximum Level Sum of a Binary Tree - Solution Explained

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the level in a binary tree that has the maximum sum of node values.  The levels are numbered starting from 1 (root is level 1). If multiple levels have the same maximum sum, we return the level with the smallest level number.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The most efficient approach to solve this problem is using Breadth-First Search (BFS) with a queue. BFS naturally processes the tree level by level.  We iterate through each level, calculating the sum of nodes at that level. We keep track of the maximum sum encountered so far and the corresponding level.  This approach is chosen because it avoids unnecessary recursive calls and directly processes each level, making the level sum calculation straightforward.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * `TreeNode`:  Represents a node in the binary tree (provided by LeetCode).
    * `Queue<TreeNode>`: A queue is used to implement BFS, storing nodes to be processed level by level.  `LinkedList` is used as its implementation, offering efficient `offer` (enqueue) and `poll` (dequeue) operations.

* **Algorithms:**
    * **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**  A graph traversal algorithm that explores the tree level by level.
    * **Level-order Traversal:** A specific type of BFS that processes nodes level by level.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxLevelSum(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null) return 0; // Handle empty tree case

        int sum = Integer.MIN_VALUE; // Initialize max sum to the smallest possible integer value
        int ans = 0; // Initialize the level with max sum
        int lev = 0; // Initialize the level counter
        Queue<TreeNode> q = new LinkedList<>(); // Create a queue for BFS
        q.offer(root); // Add the root node to the queue

        while(!q.isEmpty()) { // Continue until the queue is empty
            lev++; // Increment level counter
            int n = q.size(); // Get the number of nodes at the current level
            int lsum = 0; // Initialize the sum for the current level

            for(int i = 0 ; i<n ; i++) { // Iterate through nodes at the current level
                TreeNode node = q.poll(); // Remove and process the next node
                lsum += node.val; // Add the node's value to the level sum

                if(node.left != null) q.offer(node.left); // Add left child to queue
                if(node.right != null) q.offer(node.right); // Add right child to queue
            }

            if(sum < lsum) { // Check if current level sum is greater than the max sum so far
                sum = lsum; // Update max sum
                ans = lev; // Update the level with max sum
            }
        }

        return ans; // Return the level with the maximum sum
    }
}
```

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree.  Each node is visited and processed exactly once during the BFS traversal.

* **Space Complexity:** O(W), where W is the maximum width (maximum number of nodes at any level) of the binary tree. In the worst-case scenario (a complete binary tree), W can be equal to N/2, resulting in O(N) space complexity in the worst case. This is due to the queue used to store nodes at each level during BFS. In a balanced tree, this would be O(log N), and in a skewed tree, it could be O(N).  Therefore, the space complexity is dominated by the queue's size.


The solution is optimal in terms of time complexity, as it avoids redundant operations. The space complexity is also reasonable, considering the nature of BFS and the tree structure.  The space complexity would be significantly worse if we used a recursive Depth-First Search approach for this problem.
