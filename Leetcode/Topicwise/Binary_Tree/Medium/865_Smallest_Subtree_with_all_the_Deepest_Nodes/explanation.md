## LeetCode: Smallest Subtree with All the Deepest Nodes - Solution Explained

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the smallest subtree in a binary tree that contains all the deepest nodes.  "Deepest nodes" refers to the nodes that are farthest from the root.  The solution should return the root of this smallest subtree.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution employs a two-step approach:

1. **Find the maximum depth:**  The `max` function performs a depth-first search (DFS) to determine the maximum depth (`d`) of the tree. This is a straightforward recursive traversal.

2. **Find the subtree:** The `dfs` function performs another DFS.  It traverses the tree, keeping track of the current depth (`cd`).  When it reaches a depth equal to the maximum depth (`cd == d`), it checks if both the left and right subtrees are at the maximum depth. If both are at max depth or one subtree is at max depth and the other is null, it means we've found the smallest subtree containing all deepest nodes.  If both the left and right subtrees are not at the maximum depth, then it returns whichever subtree has a node at max depth (or null if neither does). This elegantly handles cases where the deepest nodes are not on the same level.

This approach is efficient because it avoids unnecessary traversals. It directly targets the deepest nodes and works its way up to identify the smallest encompassing subtree.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:** The primary data structure used is the `TreeNode` representing the nodes in the binary tree.  No other significant data structures are explicitly used; the recursion implicitly uses the call stack.
* **Algorithms:** Depth-First Search (DFS) is the core algorithm used in both the `max` and `dfs` functions.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **`TreeNode` Class:** This is a standard definition for a node in a binary tree, including its value (`val`) and references to its left and right children (`left`, `right`).

* **`max(TreeNode node)`:** This recursive function calculates the maximum depth of the tree. It recursively computes the depth of the left and right subtrees and returns 1 plus the maximum of these depths. The base case is when `node` is `null`, returning 0.

* **`dfs(TreeNode node, int cd)`:** This recursive function performs a DFS to find the smallest subtree containing all deepest nodes.  `cd` represents the current depth.
    * Base case: If `node` is `null`, it returns `null`.
    * If `cd` equals the maximum depth (`d`), it means we've reached a deepest node, so it returns the current `node`.
    * Otherwise, it recursively calls `dfs` on the left and right subtrees, incrementing `cd`.
    * If both left and right subtrees return non-null nodes, it means we found deepest nodes in both subtrees, so the current node is the root of the smallest subtree containing all of them, and it returns the current node.
    * If one subtree returns a node and the other is null, it returns the non-null node.

* **`subtreeWithAllDeepest(TreeNode root)`:** This is the main function. It first calls `max` to determine the maximum depth `d` and then calls `dfs` with the root and initial depth 1 to find and return the root of the smallest subtree.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.  Both `max` and `dfs` traverse the tree once.  Although there are two recursive functions, they are both linear time.

* **Space Complexity:** O(H), where H is the height of the tree.  This is due to the recursive call stack used by both `max` and `dfs`. In the worst case (a skewed tree), H can be equal to N, resulting in O(N) space complexity. In the best case (a balanced tree), H is log₂N, resulting in O(log₂N) space complexity.

In summary, this solution provides an efficient and elegant way to solve the "Smallest Subtree with all the Deepest Nodes" problem using DFS. The use of two recursive functions, one for finding the maximum depth and another for finding the subtree, makes the code concise and readable while maintaining optimal time and space complexity.
