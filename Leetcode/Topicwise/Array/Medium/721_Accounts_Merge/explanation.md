### 1. Intuition

The problem asks us to merge email accounts that belong to the same person.  Imagine you have a bunch of sticky notes, each representing an email account.  Some sticky notes have overlapping email addresses, indicating they belong to the same person.  The goal is to group these sticky notes together based on their shared emails.  We can achieve this using a Union-Find algorithm, which efficiently merges sets (accounts) based on shared elements (emails).

### 2. Approach

The solution uses a Union-Find data structure to efficiently merge accounts with shared emails. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `par` array:  Represents the parent of each account. Initially, each account is its own parent (`par[i] = i`).
   - `size` array: Tracks the size of each group (initially 1 for each account).
   - `map`: A HashMap to store email addresses and their corresponding account indices. This allows for quick lookups.

2. **Union-Find:**
   - The code iterates through each account's emails (excluding the name).
   - For each email, it checks if the email is already in the `map`.
     - If the email exists (meaning this email belongs to another account), it uses the `union` function to merge the two accounts' groups.
     - If the email doesn't exist, it adds the email to the `map` associating it with the current account's index.
   - The `union` function uses path compression and union by size for efficiency.  Path compression flattens the tree structure of the Union-Find, while union by size ensures that the larger group becomes the parent, leading to a balanced tree and faster operations.

3. **Grouping Emails:**
   - After merging, the code iterates through the `map`.
   - For each email, it finds the root parent of its corresponding account (`find` function).
   - It then adds the email to a list associated with this root parent in the `val` map. This effectively groups all emails belonging to the same person.

4. **Constructing Result:**
   - Finally, the code iterates through the `val` map.  For each root parent (representing a unique person), it creates a list containing the name from the original `accounts` list and the sorted emails from `val`.  This forms the final merged accounts list.


### 3. Data Structures

- **`par` (integer array):** Used for the Union-Find data structure. `par[i]` represents the parent of account `i`.
- **`size` (integer array):** Also for Union-Find. `size[i]` stores the size of the group rooted at `i`.
- **`map` (HashMap<String, Integer>):** Stores email addresses as keys and their corresponding account indices as values. Enables fast lookups of emails.
- **`val` (HashMap<Integer, ArrayList<String>>):**  Stores the root index (representing a person) as keys and a list of emails belonging to that person as values.
- **`ans` (List<List<String>>):** The final result, a list of merged accounts. Each inner list contains the name followed by the sorted emails of a person.


### 4. Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(M log M + N α(N)), where N is the number of accounts and M is the total number of emails. Iterating through accounts and emails takes O(M). The Union-Find operations (`find` and `union`) with path compression and union by size have an amortized time complexity of almost constant time α(N) (inverse Ackermann function which grows incredibly slowly). Sorting the emails in each account takes O(M log M).

- **Space Complexity:** O(M + N).  The `map`, `par`, `size`, and `val` maps store at most M emails and N accounts.  The `ans` list stores the merged accounts, taking at most O(M) space in the worst case.
