## LeetCode: Accounts Merge - Detailed Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to merge email accounts that belong to the same person.  Each account is represented as a list of strings, where the first string is the person's name, and the rest are their email addresses. If two accounts share at least one email address, they belong to the same person and should be merged into a single account. The output should be a list of merged accounts, where each account's emails are sorted alphabetically.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution uses a Union-Find (Disjoint Set) algorithm to efficiently group accounts that share email addresses.  This approach is chosen because it allows us to quickly determine if two accounts are connected (belong to the same person) and merge them.

The algorithm works as follows:

1. **Initialization:** Create a Union-Find data structure to represent the accounts. Each account initially forms its own disjoint set.
2. **Union Operation:** Iterate through the accounts and their emails.  If two emails belong to different accounts, perform a union operation to merge their corresponding sets.
3. **Find Operation:** After merging, use the `find` operation to determine the root of each set (the representative account for the group).
4. **Merge Emails:** Create a map to store the emails associated with each root account.
5. **Output:** For each root account, gather all its emails (from the map), sort them, prepend the account's name, and add the resulting merged account to the output list.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * `List<List<String>>`: To represent the input and output accounts.
    * `Map<String, Integer>`: To map email addresses to their corresponding account indices.
    * `Map<Integer, ArrayList<String>>`: To map root account indices to their merged email lists.
    * `int[] par`: Parent array for the Union-Find data structure.
    * `int[] size`: Size array for Union-Find (used for Union by Rank optimization).

* **Algorithms:**
    * **Union-Find (Disjoint Set):** To efficiently merge and find connected components (accounts).  The code utilizes path compression and union by size (or rank) for optimized performance.
    * **Hash Table:** To provide fast lookups of emails and account indices.
    * **Sorting:** To sort the emails within each merged account.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **`accountsMerge(List<List<String>> accounts)`:** This is the main function. It initializes the Union-Find data structure (`par`, `size`), creates a map to link emails to accounts, performs union operations, creates a map of root accounts to emails, and finally constructs the result list.

* **`find(int a)`:** This function performs path compression in the Union-Find data structure.  It finds the root parent of element `a` and updates the parent pointers along the path for faster future lookups.

* **`union(int a, int b)`:** This function performs the union operation in the Union-Find data structure, merging the sets containing `a` and `b`.  It uses Union by Size (or Rank) optimization, attaching the smaller set to the root of the larger set to keep the tree relatively balanced.

* **Iteration and Mapping:** The code iterates through the accounts and their emails to establish connections using the `map` and `union` function.

* **Result Construction:** The final loop combines the name and sorted emails to construct the result.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(MlogM + Nα(N)), where N is the number of accounts and M is the total number of emails.  The dominant factors are iterating through emails (O(M)), sorting emails (O(MlogM)), and Union-Find operations which take O(Nα(N)) with path compression and union by rank. α(N) is the inverse Ackermann function which grows incredibly slowly, making this almost linear in practice.

* **Space Complexity:** O(M + N).  This comes from the `map` storing email-account mappings, and the Union-Find arrays `par` and `size`.  The intermediate lists and maps also contribute, but proportionally to the number of accounts and emails.

The solution offers an efficient way to merge the accounts with better-than-brute-force time complexity due to the optimizations used in the Union-Find data structure.  The space complexity is also relatively efficient as it is directly proportional to the input size.  The `size` array in the `union` function (Union by Size) is an important optimization which prevents the Union-Find from becoming too tall and improving performance significantly.
