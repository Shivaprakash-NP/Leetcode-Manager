## LeetCode: Insert Interval - Solution Explained

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The "Insert Interval" problem asks us to insert a new interval into a list of non-overlapping, sorted intervals.  The output should be a new list of non-overlapping, sorted intervals, incorporating the new interval. Overlapping intervals should be merged into a single interval.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution employs a straightforward, iterative approach.  It leverages the fact that the input intervals are already sorted. The core logic involves three phases:

* **Phase 1: Add intervals before overlap:**  Iterate through the input intervals until we find one that *overlaps* with the `newInterval`.  All intervals *before* the overlap are added directly to the result list.

* **Phase 2: Merge overlapping intervals:** Once an overlap is detected, we iteratively merge the `newInterval` with any overlapping intervals. This is done by updating `newInterval`'s start and end points to encompass the entire range of overlapping intervals.

* **Phase 3: Add remaining intervals:** After merging, we add the (now potentially expanded) `newInterval` to the result list, followed by any remaining intervals from the input list that come *after* the overlap.

This approach is efficient because it only requires a single pass through the sorted input intervals.  It avoids the need for more complex sorting or searching algorithms.

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**  `ArrayList<int[]>` is used to dynamically build the resulting list of intervals.  This allows for efficient insertion of intervals as we process them.  The input and output are represented using 2D integer arrays (`int[][]`).

* **Algorithms:** The solution primarily utilizes iterative traversal and comparison operations.  It doesn't use any sophisticated algorithms like mergesort or binary search, as the sorted input simplifies the process.

**4. Code Walkthrough:**

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] insert(int[][] intervals, int[] newInterval) {
        ArrayList<int[]> ans = new ArrayList<>(); // Initialize an ArrayList to store the result.
        int i = 0; // Index to iterate through the intervals array.
        int n = intervals.length; // Store the length of the intervals array for efficiency.

        // Phase 1: Add intervals before overlap
        while(i<n && intervals[i][1] < newInterval[0]) ans.add(intervals[i++]);

        // Phase 2: Merge overlapping intervals
        while(i<n && newInterval[1] >= intervals[i][0]) {
            newInterval[0] = Math.min(newInterval[0] , intervals[i][0]); // Update start of newInterval
            newInterval[1] = Math.max(newInterval[1] , intervals[i][1]); // Update end of newInterval
            i++; //Move to the next interval
        }
        ans.add(newInterval); // Add the merged newInterval to the result.

        // Phase 3: Add remaining intervals
        while(i<n) ans.add(intervals[i++]);

        return ans.toArray(new int[ans.size()][]); // Convert ArrayList to int[][] and return.
    }
}
```

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of intervals in the input array.  This is because we iterate through the input array at most once in each phase. The merging process within the second while loop takes constant time for each interval.

* **Space Complexity:** O(N) in the worst case. This is because the `ArrayList` `ans` could potentially store all N intervals in the input if there are no overlaps.  The space used to store the result is proportional to the number of intervals.  In the best case (inserting a single interval which doesn't overlap anything), the space complexity would be O(1).

In summary, this solution provides an efficient and elegant way to solve the Insert Interval problem by taking advantage of the sorted nature of the input intervals and using a simple iterative approach.  The time and space complexities are both linear, making it a suitable solution for most practical scenarios.
