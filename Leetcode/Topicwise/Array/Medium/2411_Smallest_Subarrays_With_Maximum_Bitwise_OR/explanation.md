## LeetCode: Smallest Subarrays With Maximum Bitwise OR - Solution Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the length of the smallest subarray, starting at each index `i` in the input array `nums`, such that the bitwise OR of all elements within that subarray is maximal (equal to the bitwise OR of all elements in `nums`).  In simpler terms, for each starting position, we want to find the shortest subarray whose bitwise OR encompasses all the bits set in the entire input array.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution utilizes a clever iterative approach starting from the right end of the array.  It leverages the fact that the bitwise OR operation is associative and commutative.  Instead of directly calculating the bitwise OR of all subarrays, it maintains a `map` to track the rightmost index of each bit (0-31) encountered so far. This allows us to efficiently determine the minimum window size.

The algorithm iterates through the array from right to left. For each element, it checks its bits. If a bit is set, it updates the rightmost index of that bit in the `map`.  The minimum subarray length ending at the current index is then determined by finding the maximum rightmost index among all the bits present in the current element and calculating the difference from the current index. This efficiently avoids unnecessary OR calculations for every subarray.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * `int[] nums`: The input array of integers.
    * `int[] ans`: The output array storing the lengths of the smallest subarrays.
    * `int[] map`: An array of size 32 to store the rightmost index of each bit (0-31) encountered.  This acts as a lookup table for efficient bit tracking.

* **Algorithms:**
    * **Iterative approach:** The solution uses an iterative approach to traverse the array from right to left.
    * **Bit manipulation:** The core logic involves bitwise operations (`&`, `>>`) to efficiently check and process individual bits within each integer.
    * **Greedy approach (Implicit):** By expanding the window only when necessary (based on bit presence), the solution implicitly uses a greedy strategy to find the smallest subarray.

**4. Code Walkthrough:**

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] smallestSubarrays(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] ans = new int[n]; // Output array to store subarray lengths
        int[] map = new int[32]; // Map to track rightmost index of each bit
        Arrays.fill(map, -1); // Initialize map with -1 (no bit seen yet)

        for(int i = n-1; i>=0; i--) { // Iterate from right to left
            int tem = nums[i]; // Current element
            int r = i; // Rightmost index of the smallest subarray

            for(int j = 0; j<32; j++) { // Iterate through bits (0-31)
                if((tem&1) == 1) { // If j-th bit is set
                    map[j] = i; // Update rightmost index of j-th bit
                }
                tem = tem>>1; // Right-shift to check next bit
                if(map[j] != -1) r = Math.max(r, map[j]); // Update rightmost index 'r'
            }
            ans[i] = r-i+1; // Length of smallest subarray starting at 'i'
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(N*logM), where N is the length of `nums` and M is the maximum value in `nums`.  The outer loop iterates N times. The inner loop iterates 32 times (number of bits) in the worst case.  In essence, it's linear with respect to the number of bits that need to be processed across all elements. Since the number of bits is roughly logarithmic to the maximum value in the array, the overall time complexity can be approximated as O(N*logM).

* **Space Complexity:** O(1).  The space used by `map` is constant (32 integers), regardless of the input array size.  The output array `ans` also has the same size as the input array, which is considered part of the problem's output and not additional space used by the algorithm itself.  Therefore, the space complexity is considered constant or O(1).  Ignoring the space for output, only `map` requires constant extra space.

This solution is efficient because it avoids redundant calculations by cleverly tracking the rightmost index of each bit. The use of bit manipulation makes it performant for handling individual bits.
