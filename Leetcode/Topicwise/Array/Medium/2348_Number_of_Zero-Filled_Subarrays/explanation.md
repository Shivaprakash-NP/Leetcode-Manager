## LeetCode: Number of Zero-Filled Subarrays - Solution Explained

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to count the total number of subarrays within a given integer array `nums` that contain only zeros.  For example, in `[1, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]`, there are subarrays `[0, 0]`, `[0, 0, 0]`, `[0]`, `[0]`, and `[0, 0, 0]`  leading to a total count of 6 zero-filled subarrays.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution uses a clever approach to avoid nested loops which would lead to O(n^2) time complexity.  Instead, it iterates through the array only once.  The core idea is that if we encounter a sequence of consecutive zeros, the number of zero-filled subarrays within that sequence can be calculated directly using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:  `n * (n + 1) / 2`, where 'n' is the length of the zero sequence.  This formula efficiently calculates the number of subarrays within a sequence of consecutive zeros.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:** The primary data structure used is an array (implicitly through the `nums` input). No other explicit data structures are used.
* **Algorithms:** The algorithm utilizes a single pass iteration, and the mathematical formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to count subarrays.  It's essentially a counting algorithm.

**4. Code Walkthrough:**

```java
class Solution {
    public long zeroFilledSubarray(int[] nums) {
        long ans = 0; // Initialize the total count of zero-filled subarrays.  Using long to handle potentially large numbers.
        long c = 0; // Counter for consecutive zeros.

        for(int v : nums) { // Iterate through each element 'v' in the 'nums' array.
            if(v == 0) {
                c++; // Increment the consecutive zero counter if the element is 0.
            } else {
                // If a non-zero element is encountered, calculate the subarrays within the previous zero sequence.
                ans += (c * (c + 1)) / 2; 
                c = 0; // Reset the consecutive zero counter.
            }
        }
        // Handle any remaining consecutive zeros at the end of the array.
        ans += (c * (c + 1)) / 2; 
        return ans;
    }
}
```

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because the code iterates through the array only once.
* **Space Complexity:** O(1). The solution uses only a constant amount of extra space to store the variables `ans` and `c`.  The space used doesn't scale with the input size.


In summary, this solution efficiently solves the "Number of Zero-Filled Subarrays" problem using a single pass through the input array and a clever mathematical formula to count subarrays, resulting in an optimal O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.  The use of a `long` data type prevents potential integer overflow issues when dealing with large input arrays that could lead to very many zero-filled subarrays.
