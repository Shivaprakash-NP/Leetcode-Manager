## LeetCode: Range Product Queries of Powers - Detailed Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to calculate the product of powers of 2 for ranges specified in a series of queries.  Given an integer `n`, we first identify the powers of 2 that are present in the binary representation of `n`. Then, for each query `[start, end]`, we compute the product of the powers of 2 at indices `start` to `end` (inclusive) from the list of powers obtained earlier. The final result is an array containing the products for each query, with all calculations performed modulo 1,000,000,007 to prevent integer overflow.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution employs a two-step approach:

1. **Extract Powers of 2:**  The code first iterates through the binary representation of `n` to find the powers of 2 that sum up to `n`. This is efficiently done using bit manipulation (`tem&1` and `tem>>=1`). Each power of 2 found is added to a list.

2. **Process Queries:** For each query `[start, end]`, it iterates through the extracted powers of 2 in the specified range (`list.get(v)`) and computes their product modulo `mod`.  The result is stored in the `ans` array.

This approach is efficient because extracting the powers of 2 is linear in the number of bits of `n` (which is logarithmic in `n`), and processing each query is linear in the length of the range specified in the query.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * `ArrayList<Long>`: Stores the powers of 2 extracted from the binary representation of `n`.  `Long` is used to prevent potential integer overflow during intermediate calculations.
    * `int[]`: Stores the results (products) for each query.

* **Algorithms:**
    * **Bit Manipulation:** Used to efficiently extract powers of 2 from the binary representation of `n`.
    * **Modulo Arithmetic:** Used to prevent integer overflow during product calculations.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **`productQueries(int n, int[][] queries)`:** This is the main function that takes the integer `n` and the array of queries as input.
* **`mod = 1_000_000_007;`:** Defines the modulo constant to prevent integer overflow.
* **`size = queries.length;`:** Stores the number of queries for later use.
* **`List<Long> list = new ArrayList<>();`:** Creates an ArrayList to store the powers of 2.
* **`while(tem != 0)` loop:** This loop iterates through the binary representation of `n`.
    * `if((tem&1) == 1)`: Checks if the least significant bit is 1 (indicating a power of 2 is present).
    * `list.add((long)Math.pow(2, i)%mod);`: If a power of 2 is found, it's added to the list after calculating it modulo `mod`.
    * `tem>>=1;`: Right-shifts `tem` by 1 bit, moving to the next bit.
    * `i++;`: Increments the index representing the power of 2.
* **`int[] ans = new int[size];`:** Creates an array to store the results of the queries.
* **`for(int k = 0; k<size; k++)` loop:** Iterates through each query.
    * `st = queries[k][0]; ed = queries[k][1];`: Extracts the start and end indices of the range from the query.
    * `long pro = 1;`: Initializes the product to 1.
    * **`for(int v = st; v<=ed; v++)` loop:** Iterates through the specified range in the `list`.
        * `pro = (pro * (list.get(v)%mod))%mod;`: Multiplies the current product by the power of 2 at index `v` (modulo `mod`).
    * `ans[k] = (int)pro;`: Stores the final product in the `ans` array.
* **`return ans;`:** Returns the array containing the results.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(B + Q * R), where B is the number of bits in `n`, Q is the number of queries, and R is the maximum range size in any query.  The first loop takes O(B) time, and the nested loop takes O(Q * R) time.

* **Space Complexity:** O(B + Q).  The `list` can store at most B powers of 2, and `ans` stores Q results.  The space used by the input `queries` is not considered part of the space complexity of the algorithm.


In summary, the provided Java code efficiently solves the "Range Product Queries of Powers" problem using bit manipulation, modulo arithmetic, and straightforward iteration. The time complexity is dominated by processing the queries, and the space complexity is linear in the number of bits in `n` and the number of queries.
