## Closest Nodes Queries in a Binary Search Tree - Solution Explained

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the closest nodes in a Binary Search Tree (BST) to a given list of query values.  For each query value, we need to find the largest node value less than or equal to the query and the smallest node value greater than or equal to the query. If a query value is present in the BST, both the smaller and larger values will be equal to the query value itself.  The results should be returned as a list of lists, where each inner list contains the smaller and larger closest node values for a corresponding query.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution leverages the properties of a Binary Search Tree.  The key idea is to:

1. **In-order traversal:** Perform an in-order traversal of the BST to obtain a sorted list of node values (`val`). This is crucial because binary search can only be applied to sorted data. The `dfs` function performs this in-order traversal.

2. **Binary Search:** For each query value, perform a binary search on the sorted list (`val`) to find the closest smaller and larger values. The `bs` function handles this efficiently.  Since the list is sorted, we can easily identify the closest values by checking the elements around the middle point of the search space during binary search.

This approach is chosen because it offers optimal time complexity. In-order traversal takes linear time, and binary search for each query takes logarithmic time. This results in an overall time complexity better than nested iteration or other less efficient methods.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * `TreeNode`: Represents a node in the Binary Search Tree.
    * `List<List<Integer>> ans`: Stores the final results (list of [smaller, larger] pairs).
    * `List<Integer> val`: Stores the sorted node values obtained from the in-order traversal.
    * `ArrayList`: Used to implement the lists.

* **Algorithms:**
    * **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Used for in-order traversal of the BST.
    * **Binary Search:** Used to efficiently find the closest values in the sorted list.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **`TreeNode` class:** This is a standard definition for a tree node, providing the `val`, `left`, and `right` attributes.

* **`dfs(TreeNode node)`:** This function performs an in-order traversal of the BST.  It recursively visits the left subtree, adds the current node's value to the `val` list, and then recursively visits the right subtree.  This ensures the `val` list is sorted.

* **`bs(int v)`:** This function performs binary search on the `val` list for a given query value `v`. It initializes `l` and `r` as the start and end indices of the list, respectively. `c` and `f` store the closest values (closest smaller and closest larger). The loop continues until the left index crosses the right index.  The middle element is checked. If it matches the query, both closest values are equal to the query value. If it's smaller, it's a potential closest smaller value (`f`), and we search in the right half. If it's larger, it's a potential closest larger value (`c`), and we search in the left half.


* **`closestNodes(TreeNode root, List<Integer> queries)`:** This is the main function. It first performs in-order traversal using `dfs` to populate the `val` list. Then, it iterates through the `queries` list, calling `bs` for each query to find the closest smaller and larger values and adding the result to `ans`. Finally, it returns the `ans` list.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:**
    * `dfs`: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the BST, as it visits each node once.
    * `bs`: O(M log N), where M is the number of queries, and log N is the time complexity of binary search.
    * Overall: O(N + M log N).  The in-order traversal dominates if the number of queries is relatively small compared to the number of nodes.

* **Space Complexity:**
    * `val`: O(N) to store the sorted node values.
    * `ans`: O(M) to store the results for M queries.
    * Recursive call stack in `dfs`: O(H) in the worst case (skewed tree), where H is the height of the BST (can be N in the worst case).
    * Overall: O(N + M + H) which simplifies to O(N) in the worst case.


In summary, this solution efficiently utilizes the properties of BSTs and binary search to solve the problem with a time complexity of O(N + M log N) and a space complexity of O(N), making it an optimal solution for this problem.
