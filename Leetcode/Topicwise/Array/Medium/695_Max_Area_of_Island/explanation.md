## LeetCode: Max Area of Island - Solution Explained

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the maximum area (number of connected 1s) of an island in a given binary matrix (a grid where 0 represents water and 1 represents land).  Islands are formed by horizontally or vertically connected 1s.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution employs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to explore each island.  We iterate through the grid.  Whenever we encounter a '1' (land) that hasn't been visited, we initiate a BFS traversal from that point.  During the BFS, we count the number of connected '1's, representing the area of the current island. We keep track of the maximum area encountered so far.  This approach is chosen because BFS efficiently explores all connected components in a graph (in this case, the island).  Depth-First Search (DFS) would also work, but BFS is often preferred for its better memory management in scenarios with very large, wide islands.

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * `int[][] grid`:  The input 2D array representing the grid.
    * `boolean[][] vis`: A 2D boolean array to keep track of visited cells.  This prevents revisiting cells and ensures we count each island's area only once.
    * `int[][] dir`: A 2D array storing the four possible directions (up, down, left, right) for movement in the grid.
    * `Queue<int[]> q`: A queue to implement the BFS algorithm. It stores coordinates of cells to be visited.

* **Algorithms:**
    * **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**  Used to explore each island and count its area.
    * **Iteration:**  Used to traverse the grid initially and find the starting points of islands.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **Initialization:**
    * `n`, `m`: Store the dimensions of the grid.
    * `vis`: Initializes a boolean matrix to keep track of visited cells (all initially false).
    * `dir`: Defines the four directions for movement in the grid.
    * `ans`: Initializes a variable to store the maximum area found so far (initially 0).


* **Outer Loops:**
    * The nested `for` loops iterate through each cell of the grid.

* **Island Detection and BFS:**
    * `if(grid[i][j] == 1 && !vis[i][j])`: This condition checks if the current cell contains land ('1') and hasn't been visited yet. If both are true, it signifies the start of a new island.

* **BFS Traversal:**
    * `Queue<int[]> q = new LinkedList<>()`: A queue is created to manage the BFS.
    * `cursum`: Variable to track the current island's area.
    * The `while(!q.isEmpty())` loop performs the BFS:
        * `int[] p = q.poll()`:  Retrieves the coordinates of the next cell to visit.
        * `cursum++`: Increments the area count.
        * The inner `for` loop iterates through the four directions:
            * `ni`, `nj`: Calculate the coordinates of the neighboring cell in the current direction.
            * The `if` condition checks if the neighbor is within the grid boundaries, is land ('1'), and hasn't been visited.  If true, it's added to the queue and marked as visited.

* **Updating Maximum Area:**
    * `ans = Math.max(ans, cursum);`: After exploring a complete island, its area (`cursum`) is compared with the current maximum area (`ans`), and `ans` is updated if necessary.


* **Return Value:**
    * `return ans;`:  The function returns the maximum area of an island found in the grid.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(M * N), where M and N are the dimensions of the grid. This is because we visit each cell at most once (due to the `vis` array).  The BFS operation within each island takes time proportional to the island's size, but the sum of all island sizes is at most M * N.

* **Space Complexity:** O(M * N) in the worst case. This is dominated by the `vis` array which stores the visited status of each cell. In the worst case (where the entire grid is an island), the queue used in BFS can also have a size of up to M * N.  The `dir` array takes constant space.
