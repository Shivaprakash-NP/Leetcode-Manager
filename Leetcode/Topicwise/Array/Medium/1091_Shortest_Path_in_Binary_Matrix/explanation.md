## LeetCode: Shortest Path in Binary Matrix - Solution Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the shortest path from the top-left corner (0,0) to the bottom-right corner (n-1, n-1) of an n x n binary matrix.  The matrix contains only 0s and 1s, where 0 represents an open cell and 1 represents a blocked cell.  We can move in any of the eight directions (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally). If no path exists, we return -1.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

This solution uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path. BFS is ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph because it explores all nodes at a given distance from the starting node before moving to nodes farther away.  We systematically explore the matrix, marking visited cells to avoid cycles.

This approach is chosen because BFS guarantees that the first time we reach the destination, it will be through the shortest path.  Other approaches like Depth-First Search (DFS) might find a path, but not necessarily the shortest one.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * `Queue<int[]> q`: A queue to store the coordinates of cells to be visited.  `int[]` represents a cell's (row, column) coordinates.
    * `int[][] grid`: The input binary matrix. We modify this in-place to mark visited cells.
    * `int[][] dir`: A 2D array storing the eight possible movement directions.

* **Algorithms:**
    * **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** The core algorithm used to explore the matrix.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **Initialization:**
    * `n = grid.length;`: Gets the size of the matrix.
    * `if(grid[0][0] == 1 || grid[n-1][n-1] == 1) return -1;`: Checks if the starting or ending cell is blocked. If so, no path exists.
    * `Queue<int[]> q = new LinkedList<>();`: Initializes the queue for BFS.
    * `q.offer(new int[]{0, 0});`: Adds the starting cell (0,0) to the queue.
    * `grid[0][0] = -1;`: Marks the starting cell as visited (-1).
    * `s = 0;`: Initializes the path length counter.
    * `f = false;`: A flag indicating whether the destination is reached.
    * `int[][] dir = {{1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, -1}, {1, 1}, {-1, -1}, {1, -1}, {-1, 1}};`: Defines the eight possible movement directions.

* **BFS Loop:**
    * `while(!q.isEmpty() && !f)`: Continues BFS until the queue is empty or the destination is reached.
    * `int size = q.size();`: Gets the number of cells at the current level.
    * `for(int i = 0; i<size ; i++)`: Iterates through the cells at the current level.
    * `int[] p = q.poll();`: Removes a cell from the queue.
    * `if(p[0] == n-1 && p[1] == n-1) f = true;`: Checks if the destination is reached.
    * `for(int[] d : dir)`: Iterates through the eight possible directions.
    * `int ni = p[0]+d[0]; int nj = p[1]+d[1];`: Calculates the coordinates of the next cell.
    * `if(ni>=0 && nj>=0 && ni<n && nj<n && grid[ni][nj] == 0)`: Checks if the next cell is within the bounds of the matrix and is not blocked or visited.
    * `int[] add = new int[]{ni, nj}; q.offer(add); grid[ni][nj] = -1;`: Adds the next cell to the queue and marks it as visited.
    * `s++;`: Increments the path length counter after processing a level.

* **Result:**
    * `return (f)?s:-1;`: Returns the path length (`s`) if the destination is reached (`f` is true), otherwise returns -1.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(N^2), where N is the size of the matrix. In the worst case, we might visit every cell in the matrix.  The BFS loop iterates through each cell at most once.

* **Space Complexity:** O(N^2) in the worst case. The queue can store up to all the cells of the matrix if the matrix is mostly 0s (unblocked). The space used by the `grid` array is already accounted for in the input size.


This solution efficiently solves the Shortest Path in Binary Matrix problem using BFS and provides a clear and concise implementation.  The use of the `grid` array to track visited cells avoids redundant exploration and improves efficiency.
