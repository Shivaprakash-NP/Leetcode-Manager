## Combination Sum Problem Explanation

Here's a detailed explanation of the provided Java code for the "Combination Sum" LeetCode problem.

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The "Combination Sum" problem asks us to find all possible combinations of numbers from a given array `candidates` that sum up to a given `target` value.  We can use the same number from `candidates` multiple times in a combination. Each combination should be returned as a list of integers, and the final result should be a list of lists containing all unique combinations.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The solution uses a backtracking approach, which is a common technique for solving combination and permutation problems. Here's the intuition:

*   **Recursive Exploration:** We recursively explore all possible paths by either including or excluding a candidate number at each step.
*   **Base Case:** When we reach the end of the `candidates` array (index equals array length), we check if the current sum (`t`) equals the `target`. If it does, we've found a valid combination, so we add it to our `ans` list.
*   **Inclusion:** If the current candidate is less than or equal to the remaining `target` value, we include it in the current combination (`ds`). We then recursively call the `find` function with the same index (allowing us to reuse the same number) and the updated `target` value (target - candidate).
*   **Exclusion:** After the inclusion branch returns (meaning all combinations starting with that candidate have been explored), we backtrack by removing the last element from the current combination (`ds`). This allows us to explore other combinations without that number.
*   **Moving to the Next Candidate:** Finally, we recursively call the `find` function with the next index (ind + 1), keeping the target the same to explore combinations without using the current candidate.

The backtracking approach guarantees that we explore all possible combinations while systematically building and pruning them.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `List<List<Integer>> ans`: Stores the final list of combinations.
    *   `List<Integer> ds`:  Represents the current combination being built during the recursive calls.
    *   `int[] candidates`: The input array containing the numbers to choose from.

*   **Algorithms:**
    *   **Backtracking:** The core algorithm used to explore all possible combinations.
    *   **Recursion:**  Used to implement the backtracking process.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    private List<List<Integer>> ans;

    private void find(int ind , int[] arr , int t , List<Integer> ds)
    {
        // Base Case: Reached the end of the candidates array
        if(ind == arr.length)
        {
            // If the current target is 0, we found a valid combination
            if(t == 0) ans.add(new ArrayList<>(ds)); // Add a COPY of the current combination

            return; // Backtrack
        }

        // Inclusion: If the current candidate can be included (candidate <= target)
        if(arr[ind]<=t)
        {
            ds.add(arr[ind]); // Add the current candidate to the combination
            find(ind , arr , t - arr[ind] , ds); // Recursive call:  same index, updated target
            ds.remove(ds.size() - 1); // Backtrack: Remove the last added element
        }

        // Exclusion: Explore combinations without the current candidate
        find(ind+1 , arr , t , ds); // Recursive call: next index, same target
    }

    public List<List<Integer>> combinationSum(int[] candidates, int target) {
        ans = new ArrayList<>(); // Initialize the result list
        find(0 , candidates , target , new ArrayList<>()); // Start the recursive process from the beginning
        return ans; // Return the result
    }
}
```

**Detailed Explanation:**

1.  **`class Solution`**: Defines the class containing the solution.
2.  **`private List<List<Integer>> ans;`**:  A member variable to store the final list of combinations. It's initialized in the `combinationSum` method.
3.  **`private void find(int ind, int[] arr, int t, List<Integer> ds)`**:
    *   This is the recursive function that performs the backtracking.
    *   `ind`: The index of the current candidate in the `candidates` array (`arr`).
    *   `arr`: The `candidates` array.
    *   `t`: The remaining target value.
    *   `ds`: The current combination being built (a list of integers).
4.  **`if (ind == arr.length)`**: This is the base case. If we've reached the end of the `candidates` array, we check if the `target` is zero.
5.  **`if (t == 0) ans.add(new ArrayList<>(ds));`**: If the `target` is zero, it means the current combination sums up to the original `target`. We add a *copy* of the `ds` list to the `ans` list.  It's crucial to create a *new* `ArrayList` because `ds` will be modified in subsequent recursive calls.  If we just add `ds` directly, all lists in `ans` would eventually be empty.
6.  **`return;`**: This `return` statement signifies that the current branch of recursion is done, and we should backtrack.
7.  **`if (arr[ind] <= t)`**: Checks if the current candidate's value is less than or equal to the remaining `target`. If it is, we can include the candidate.
8.  **`ds.add(arr[ind]);`**: Adds the current candidate to the current combination (`ds`).
9.  **`find(ind, arr, t - arr[ind], ds);`**: Recursive call to explore combinations including the current candidate. Note that `ind` remains the same to allow multiple uses of the same candidate.  The target is reduced by the candidate's value.
10. **`ds.remove(ds.size() - 1);`**:  Backtracking step. After exploring all combinations that include the current candidate, we remove it from the `ds` list to explore other possibilities.  This step ensures we explore all combinations and avoid duplicate combinations within the same path.
11. **`find(ind + 1, arr, t, ds);`**: Recursive call to explore combinations *excluding* the current candidate.  The target remains the same, and the index is incremented to consider the next candidate.
12. **`public List<List<Integer>> combinationSum(int[] candidates, int target)`**:
    *   This is the main function that is called to solve the problem.
    *   `ans = new ArrayList<>();`:  Initializes the `ans` list to store the resulting combinations.
    *   `find(0, candidates, target, new ArrayList<>());`:  Calls the recursive `find` function to start the backtracking process.  Starts with index 0, the original target, and an empty list for the initial combination.
    *   `return ans;`: Returns the `ans` list containing all the valid combinations.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is difficult to precisely determine due to the nature of backtracking. In the worst-case scenario, the algorithm might explore all possible combinations, leading to exponential time complexity.  More specifically, it is roughly O(N^(T/M + 1)), where N is the number of candidates, T is the target, and M is the minimum value in candidates.  The `N^(T/M)` part comes from the number of possible paths, and the "+1" comes from creating a new ArrayList for each valid combination. The backtracking nature of the algorithm helps to prune the search space, preventing it from exploring completely unnecessary paths, but in general, it scales poorly.

*   **Space Complexity:**
    *   O(T/M) - Depth of the recursion tree (in the best-case scenario where `M` is the smallest value in `candidates` and we only use `M` to reach `T`). This comes from the maximum number of recursive calls on the call stack.
    *   O(K) - K is the number of valid combinations. Each combination takes O(L) space, where L is the average length of a combination. In total, the space needed to store the output is O(K*L), where K is the number of lists and L is the average length of each list.
    *   The `ds` list can have a maximum size of T/M. Each `ds` is copied into the answer, so this contributes to the space complexity.
    *   Overall, the space complexity can be expressed as O(T/M + K*L). In the worst case, the number of combinations (K) can also be exponential, so the space complexity could also be exponential.

In summary, both the time and space complexity are exponential in the worst case, but the algorithm efficiently explores the search space by pruning branches using the backtracking approach.
