## Product of Array Except Self - Detailed Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The "Product of Array Except Self" problem asks us to take an integer array `nums` as input and return a new array `answer` where `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` *except* `nums[i]`.  The challenge lies in doing this efficiently, and ideally without using division.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by first calculating the product of all elements in the array.  Then, for each element, it divides the total product by the element to get the product of all other elements. A special case is implemented to handle the presence of zeros in the input array.

The initial approach of calculating the total product seems straightforward. However, it has a significant drawback: it relies on division. If we are asked to avoid division, this approach becomes invalid. Furthermore, this initial approach will fail if there are *multiple* zeros in the input array, as the total product will be zero, leading to division by zero errors even for non-zero elements, or incorrect results when dividing zero by another zero.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structure:** `int[]` (Integer Array) - Used for both the input and the output.
*   **Algorithm:** The approach contains an initial loop to compute the total product, followed by another loop that performs division based on that result. This is essentially a brute-force approach with an attempt at optimization.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] productExceptSelf(int[] nums) {
        int pro = 1; // Initialize 'pro' to 1 to store the product of all elements.
        for(int v : nums) pro*=v; // Calculate the product of all elements in 'nums'.

        int[] answer = new int[nums.length]; // Create a new array 'answer' of the same size as 'nums' to store the results.

        for(int i = 0 ; i<nums.length ; i++)
        {
            if(nums[i]==0) // Handle the case where the current element is zero.
            {
                int ans = 1; // Initialize 'ans' to 1 for the product of elements excluding nums[i].
                for(int j = 0 ; j<nums.length ; j++)
                {
                    if(j!=i) ans*=nums[j]; // Multiply all elements except nums[i] to compute the product.
                }
                answer[i] = ans; // Store the result in the 'answer' array.
            }
            else answer[i] = pro/nums[i]; // If nums[i] is not zero, divide the total product 'pro' by nums[i] to get the product of other elements.
        }
        return answer; // Return the 'answer' array.
    }
}
```

*   **`int pro = 1;`**: Initializes an integer variable `pro` to 1. This variable will store the product of all the elements in the input array `nums`.

*   **`for(int v : nums) pro*=v;`**: This is a for-each loop that iterates through each element `v` in the `nums` array. In each iteration, it multiplies `pro` by `v`, effectively calculating the product of all elements.

*   **`int[] answer = new int[nums.length];`**: This line creates a new integer array `answer` with the same length as `nums`. This array will store the final result, where `answer[i]` will be the product of all elements in `nums` except `nums[i]`.

*   **`for(int i = 0 ; i<nums.length ; i++) { ... }`**: This is the main loop that iterates through each index `i` of the `nums` array.

*   **`if(nums[i]==0) { ... }`**: This `if` statement checks if the current element `nums[i]` is equal to 0.  This is a special case that needs to be handled differently because dividing by 0 is not allowed.

    *   **`int ans = 1;`**:  Initializes an integer variable `ans` to 1. This variable will store the product of all elements in `nums` except `nums[i]`.

    *   **`for(int j = 0 ; j<nums.length ; j++) { ... }`**: This inner loop iterates through all elements in `nums` again.

        *   **`if(j!=i) ans*=nums[j];`**: This `if` statement ensures that the current element being considered in the inner loop (`nums[j]`) is not the same as the element being considered in the outer loop (`nums[i]`). If they are different, the current element `nums[j]` is multiplied with `ans`.

    *   **`answer[i] = ans;`**: After the inner loop completes, `ans` will contain the product of all elements in `nums` except `nums[i]`. This value is then stored in the `answer` array at index `i`.

*   **`else answer[i] = pro/nums[i];`**: If `nums[i]` is not equal to 0, this `else` statement executes. It divides the total product `pro` by `nums[i]` and stores the result in `answer[i]`. This directly calculates the product of all elements except `nums[i]` because `pro` already contains the product of all elements.

*   **`return answer;`**: Finally, the function returns the `answer` array, which contains the desired results.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n) + O(n) + O(n^2) in the worst case where zero exists in array.  Which simplifies to O(n^2) because O(n^2) is dominant.
    *   The first `for` loop to calculate the product takes O(n) time.
    *   The main `for` loop takes O(n) time in most cases. However if there is a `0` element it goes to the inner loop.
    *   The inner `for` loop inside the `if(nums[i] == 0)` condition takes O(n) time. This nested loop makes the worst-case scenario have O(n^2) complexity.

*   **Space Complexity:** O(n) because we create a new array `answer` of size `n` to store the results.
