### 1. Intuition

Imagine you have a set of light switches, each representing a number in the input array `nums`.  Each switch can be either ON or OFF.  Turning a switch ON corresponds to including the corresponding number in a subset, and OFF means excluding it. The "bitwise-OR" of a subset is like combining the states of the switches: if at least one switch for a particular bit is ON, the resulting bit in the OR value is also ON.  We want to find how many subsets result in the maximum possible "brightness" (maximum bitwise-OR value).

The solution uses depth-first search (DFS) to explore all possible subsets.  It keeps track of the maximum bitwise-OR value encountered so far and counts the number of subsets that achieve this maximum.

### 2. Approach

The code employs a recursive depth-first search (DFS) approach to systematically explore all possible subsets of the input array `nums`.

1. **Initialization:**  The `countMaxOrSubsets` function first calculates the maximum possible bitwise-OR value (`max`) by performing a bitwise OR operation on all elements of the `nums` array. This gives us the upper bound for the bitwise OR of any subset.  `ans` is initialized to 0 and will store the count of subsets with the maximum bitwise-OR value.

2. **Recursive DFS (`dfs` function):**
   - The `dfs` function explores all subsets recursively.
   - `i` is the index of the current element being considered.
   - `orval` accumulates the bitwise-OR of the elements included in the current subset.
   - **Base Case:** If `i` reaches the end of the array (`i == nums.length`), it means a subset has been fully explored.  If its bitwise-OR (`orval`) equals the maximum possible value (`max`), the `ans` counter is incremented.

   - **Recursive Steps:**  At each step, the algorithm makes two recursive calls:
     - `dfs(nums, i+1, orval | nums[i])`: This call includes the current element `nums[i]` in the subset, updating `orval` accordingly.
     - `dfs(nums, i+1, orval)`: This call excludes the current element `nums[i]` from the subset, keeping `orval` unchanged. This effectively explores both possibilities (include or exclude) for each element.

3. **Final Result:** After the DFS completes, the function returns `ans`, which represents the count of subsets with the maximum bitwise-OR value.


### 3. Data Structures

- **`nums` (int[]):** This array holds the input numbers.  It's the primary data structure holding the problem's input.
- **`max` (int):** An integer variable to store the maximum possible bitwise-OR value achievable from any subset of `nums`.
- **`ans` (int):** An integer variable to count the number of subsets that yield the maximum bitwise-OR value.


### 4. Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(2<sup>n</sup>), where n is the length of the `nums` array. This is because the DFS explores all 2<sup>n</sup> possible subsets.  Each recursive call performs a constant amount of work (bitwise OR and comparison).

- **Space Complexity:** O(n). The space complexity is dominated by the recursion depth of the DFS. In the worst case, the recursion depth can be n (when we explore all elements).  The space used by `max` and `ans` is constant, so it's negligible compared to the recursion stack space.  Note that the space used by the implicit recursion stack is proportional to `n` in this implementation.  A more space-efficient approach might use an iterative solution with a stack.
