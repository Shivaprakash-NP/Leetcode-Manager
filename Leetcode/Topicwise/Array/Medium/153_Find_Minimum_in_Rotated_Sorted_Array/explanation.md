## Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array - Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to find the minimum element in a rotated sorted array.  A rotated sorted array is an array that was initially sorted in ascending order, but then rotated some number of times. For example, `[4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]` is a rotated version of `[0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.  Our goal is to find the smallest element in this rotated array as efficiently as possible.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The key idea is to leverage the fact that the array is *partially* sorted.  Even though the entire array isn't sorted, there will always be at least one half of the array that *is* sorted. We can use binary search to efficiently narrow down the search space and find the minimum element.

The intuition behind the approach is as follows:

*   **Binary Search:**  Apply binary search to efficiently search the array.
*   **Check Sorted Half:** In each iteration, determine if the left half (`nums[l]` to `nums[m]`) is sorted.
*   **Update Minimum:**  If the left half is sorted, the minimum of that half is `nums[l]`. Update the `ans` with the minimum between the current `ans` and `nums[l]`.  Since the left half is sorted, the minimum cannot be in the left half so we can look for the minimum in the right half by setting `l = m+1`.
*   **Right Half Sorted:** If the left half is *not* sorted, it means the right half (`nums[m]` to `nums[r]`) must be sorted. In this case, update `ans` with the minimum between the current `ans` and `nums[m]`. The minimum cannot be in the right half because its sorted. So we can look for the minimum in the left half by setting `r = m-1`.
*   **Iterate:** Repeat until the search space is exhausted (`l > r`).

This approach avoids a linear scan of the array and takes advantage of the partially sorted nature of the rotated array.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:**  The core data structure is the input array `nums`.
*   **Algorithms:** Binary Search.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMin(int[] nums) {
        int l = 0;
        int r = nums.length-1;
        int ans = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        while(l<=r)
        {
            int m = (l+r)/2;
            if(nums[l]<=nums[m])
            {
                ans = Math.min(ans , nums[l]);
                l = m+1;
            }
            else
            {
                ans = Math.min(ans , nums[m]);
                r = m-1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   `l = 0`: Initializes the left pointer to the start of the array.
    *   `r = nums.length - 1`: Initializes the right pointer to the end of the array.
    *   `ans = Integer.MAX_VALUE`: Initializes `ans` to the largest possible integer value. This variable will store the minimum value found so far.

2.  **Binary Search Loop:**
    *   `while (l <= r)`: The loop continues as long as the left pointer is less than or equal to the right pointer. This condition ensures that the entire search space is considered.
    *   `int m = (l + r) / 2`: Calculates the middle index of the current search space.

3.  **Check if Left Half is Sorted:**
    *   `if (nums[l] <= nums[m])`:  This condition checks if the left half of the array (from `l` to `m`) is sorted in ascending order. If `nums[l]` is less than or equal to `nums[m]`, it means the left half is sorted.
        *   `ans = Math.min(ans, nums[l])`: Updates `ans` with the minimum value between the current `ans` and `nums[l]`. `nums[l]` will be the smallest number in the left sorted half.
        *   `l = m + 1`: Since the left half is sorted and we've already considered its minimum, we move the left pointer to `m + 1` to search for the minimum in the right half of the array.

4.  **Else Right Half is Sorted**
    *   `else`: If the left half is not sorted, then the right half (from `m` to `r`) must be sorted.  Because the whole array is rotated, one of the halves must be sorted.
        *   `ans = Math.min(ans, nums[m])`: Updates `ans` with the minimum value between the current `ans` and `nums[m]`. Since the right half is sorted, the smallest element cannot be in the right half except if `nums[m]` is the minimum which the code already considers.
        *   `r = m - 1`: Moves the right pointer to `m - 1` to search for the minimum in the left half of the array.

5.  **Return Result:**
    *   `return ans`: After the loop completes, the `ans` variable will contain the minimum element in the rotated sorted array.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(log n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because we are using binary search, which halves the search space in each iteration.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1), constant space. We are only using a few extra variables (`l`, `r`, `m`, `ans`) which do not depend on the size of the input array.
