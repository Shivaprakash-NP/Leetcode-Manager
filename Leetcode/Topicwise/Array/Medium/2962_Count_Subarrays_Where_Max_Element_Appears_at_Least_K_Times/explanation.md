## Explanation of LeetCode Problem: "Count Subarrays Where Max Element Appears at Least K Times"

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to count the number of subarrays in a given array `nums` where the maximum element of the array appears at least `k` times.  We need to return the *number* of such subarrays.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The key idea here is to reframe the problem. Instead of directly counting the "good" subarrays (where the max element appears at least `k` times), we count the *complement* â€“ the number of "bad" subarrays (where the max element appears *less than* `k` times).  Then, we subtract the number of "bad" subarrays from the total number of possible subarrays to obtain the desired result.

*   **Total Subarrays:** Calculating the total number of subarrays is straightforward: for an array of size `n`, there are `n * (n + 1) / 2` subarrays.

*   **Counting "Bad" Subarrays:** We use a sliding window approach to count the subarrays where the maximum element appears less than `k` times. The sliding window maintains a count `c` of the occurrences of the maximum element within the current window. We expand the window (increment `r`) until the count of the maximum element is `k`. Then, we shrink the window (increment `l`) until the count becomes `k-1` again.  At any given point, the subarray from `l` to `r` contains the max element k-1 times or less (i.e., it is a "bad" subarray). The number of such subarrays ending at index `r` is simply `r - l + 1`.

*   **Why this approach?** Directly counting the "good" subarrays would be more complex because for each subarray, we'd have to check if the maximum element appears at least `k` times, leading to a potentially higher time complexity. By counting the complement, we can leverage the sliding window technique to efficiently identify and count the "bad" subarrays.  This gives us a more optimized solution.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:** `int[] nums` (input array), `long` variables for storing counts.
*   **Algorithms:** Sliding Window, finding the maximum element of an array.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public long countSubarrays(int[] nums, int k) {
        long n = nums.length;
        long max = nums[0];
        for(int i = 1 ; i<n ; i++) max = Math.max(max , nums[i]);
        long tot = n*(n+1) / 2;
        long ans = 0;
        long l = 0;
        long c = 0;
        for(long r = 0 ; r < n ; r++) {
            if(nums[(int)r] == max) c++;
            while(c > k-1) {
                if(nums[(int)l] == max) c--;
                l++;
            }
            ans += (r-l+1);
        }
        return tot-ans;
    }
}
```

1.  **`long n = nums.length;`**:  Stores the length of the input array in the `n` variable (using `long` to prevent potential integer overflow during calculations).

2.  **`long max = nums[0];`**: Initializes `max` with the first element of the array. This variable will store the maximum element in the array.

3.  **`for(int i = 1 ; i<n ; i++) max = Math.max(max , nums[i]);`**:  Iterates through the array to find the maximum element.  It compares each element `nums[i]` with the current `max` and updates `max` accordingly.

4.  **`long tot = n*(n+1) / 2;`**: Calculates the total number of possible subarrays in `nums`. The formula `n * (n + 1) / 2` is a standard formula for the number of subarrays in an array of size `n`.

5.  **`long ans = 0;`**: Initializes `ans` to 0.  `ans` will store the count of "bad" subarrays (subarrays with less than `k` occurrences of the maximum element).

6.  **`long l = 0;`**: Initializes the left pointer `l` to 0. This pointer represents the starting index of the sliding window.

7.  **`long c = 0;`**: Initializes the count `c` to 0. This variable counts how many times the maximum element appears in the current sliding window.

8.  **`for(long r = 0 ; r < n ; r++) { ... }`**: This loop iterates through the array using the right pointer `r`. This loop expands the sliding window.

9.  **`if(nums[(int)r] == max) c++;`**: If the element at the current right pointer `nums[r]` is equal to the maximum element, increment the count `c`.

10. **`while(c > k-1) { ... }`**: This `while` loop shrinks the sliding window from the left until the count `c` of maximum elements within the window is less than or equal to `k-1`.

11. **`if(nums[(int)l] == max) c--;`**:  If the element at the left pointer `nums[l]` is the maximum element, decrement the count `c`.

12. **`l++;`**: Increment the left pointer `l`, shrinking the window from the left.

13. **`ans += (r-l+1);`**: After the `while` loop has finished shrinking the window, the current subarray from `l` to `r` contains less than `k` occurrences of the max element. The number of such subarrays *ending* at `r` is `r - l + 1`.  We add this value to `ans`.

14. **`return tot-ans;`**:  Finally, subtract the number of "bad" subarrays (`ans`) from the total number of subarrays (`tot`) to get the number of "good" subarrays.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`.
    *   Finding the maximum element takes O(n).
    *   The sliding window iterates through the array once (O(n)).  The `while` loop inside the `for` loop might *appear* to increase the complexity, but because `l` can only increment up to `n`, the `while` loop, in total, executes at most `n` times across the entire outer `for` loop.  Therefore, the sliding window part is still O(n).
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1).  We are only using a few extra variables (e.g., `max`, `tot`, `ans`, `l`, `c`), so the space complexity is constant. We are not using any additional data structures that scale with the input size.
