## Next Greater Element II: Detailed Explanation

Here's a breakdown of the provided Java code that solves the "Next Greater Element II" problem on LeetCode.

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to find the next greater element for each element in a circular array.  "Next greater element" means the first element greater than the current element, traversing the array in a circular manner. If no such element exists, we should return -1 for that element.  For example, given `nums = [1,2,1]`, the output should be `[2,-1,2]`. The first `1`'s next greater element is `2`. `2` has no next greater element in the array, so it's `-1`. The second `1`'s next greater element is `2` (wrapping around).

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is to use a stack to efficiently track potential "next greater elements."  Since the array is circular, we essentially need to iterate through it twice to consider all possible next greater elements.

The algorithm works as follows:

1. **Circular Traversal:** We conceptually treat the array as circular by iterating through it twice (from `2*n - 1` down to `0`). This ensures that we consider elements wrapping around to the beginning of the array as potential next greater elements.
2. **Stack for Candidates:**  The stack `st` stores elements that are potential next greater elements for elements we haven't yet processed.
3. **Finding the Next Greater Element:** For each element `nums[i % n]`, we pop elements from the stack that are smaller than or equal to the current element. This is because these popped elements can no longer be the "next greater element" for any element we encounter later (including the current one).  The element remaining at the top of the stack (if any) is the next greater element.
4. **Storing the Result:** Once we've identified the next greater element, we store it in the `ans` array at the correct index.  Note that we only store into the `ans` array when `i < n`, as we are effectively iterating twice and only want the results from the first loop through the original array.
5. **Pushing to the Stack:** After processing an element, we push it onto the stack. This allows it to be a potential next greater element for elements we haven't yet encountered.

**Why this approach?**

The stack allows us to efficiently maintain a decreasing sequence of elements. When we encounter a new element, we can quickly determine its next greater element by popping smaller elements from the stack. This avoids the need for nested loops, which would lead to a less efficient solution. The circular traversal ensures that we consider all elements as potential next greater elements.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structure:** `Stack<Integer>`:  Used to store elements in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) manner, facilitating the identification of the next greater element.
*   **Algorithm:** Stack-based traversal, circular array handling.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] nextGreaterElements(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        Stack<Integer> st = new Stack<>(); // Initialize a stack to store potential next greater elements.
        int[] ans = new int[n];          // Initialize the result array.
        for(int i = 2*n-1 ; i>=0 ; i--) { // Iterate from the end of the conceptually doubled array.
            int cur = nums[i%n];         // Get the current element (handles circularity with i % n).
            while(!st.isEmpty() && cur>=st.peek()) st.pop(); // Pop elements from the stack that are smaller or equal to the current element.
            if(i<n) ans[i] = (st.isEmpty())?-1:st.peek();  // If i is within the bounds of the original array, store the next greater element from stack.
            st.push(cur);                  // Push the current element onto the stack.
        }
        return ans;                      // Return the result array.
    }
}
```

*   **`int n = nums.length;`**: Stores the length of the input array.
*   **`Stack<Integer> st = new Stack<>();`**: Creates an empty stack to store elements.
*   **`int[] ans = new int[n];`**: Creates an integer array `ans` of size `n` to store the next greater elements for each element in `nums`.
*   **`for(int i = 2*n-1 ; i>=0 ; i--) { ... }`**: This loop iterates from `2*n-1` down to `0`. This is the key to handling the circular nature of the array.  Effectively, we iterate over the array twice.
*   **`int cur = nums[i%n];`**: Calculates the actual index in the `nums` array using the modulo operator (`%`). This ensures that when `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, it wraps around to the beginning of the array.
*   **`while(!st.isEmpty() && cur>=st.peek()) st.pop();`**: This `while` loop is the core of the algorithm.  It keeps popping elements from the `st` as long as the stack is not empty and the current element `cur` is greater than or equal to the element at the top of the stack. This ensures that the stack always maintains a decreasing order of elements from top to bottom.
*   **`if(i<n) ans[i] = (st.isEmpty())?-1:st.peek();`**: If the current index `i` is less than `n`, it means we're processing the first pass through the original array. In this case, we assign the next greater element to `ans[i]`. If the stack is empty, it means there's no greater element, so we assign `-1`. Otherwise, the top of the stack `st.peek()` holds the next greater element.
*   **`st.push(cur);`**: After processing the current element `cur`, it is pushed onto the stack. This makes `cur` a potential next greater element for the elements that will be processed later.
*   **`return ans;`**: Finally, the `ans` array, which contains the next greater element for each element in `nums`, is returned.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity: O(n)**

    *   The outer `for` loop iterates `2n` times.
    *   The inner `while` loop might seem like it could lead to a higher complexity, but each element is pushed onto the stack at most once and popped at most once. Therefore, the total number of push and pop operations is at most `2n`.
    *   Thus, the overall time complexity is O(2n), which simplifies to O(n).

*   **Space Complexity: O(n)**

    *   The `Stack st` can potentially store all `n` elements of the input array in the worst case (e.g., a strictly decreasing array).
    *   The `ans` array takes O(n) space.
    *   Therefore, the space complexity is O(n) + O(n) = O(n).
