## Maximum Frequency of an Element After Performing Operations I - Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to find the maximum possible frequency of any element in the given array `nums` after performing at most `k` operations.  In each operation, we can increment the value of any element in `nums` by 1.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is to iterate through each potential target value and determine the maximum frequency we can achieve for that target value, considering the cost (number of operations) required to transform other elements to that target. Then, among all these maximum frequencies, return the largest one.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1.  **Sorted Array:** Sorting the array allows us to use binary search for efficient finding of elements within a specific range.
2.  **Target Value Iteration:**  The outer loop iterates through potential target values `i`.  For each `i`, we calculate the range `[i-k, i+k]` that elements could have existed in prior to being incremented to target `i`. Elements within this range could potentially be incremented to equal `i`.
3.  **Binary Search:** We use binary search (`lowerBound` and `upperBound` functions) to determine how many elements are within `[i-k, i+k]`.
4.  **Calculate the number of operations needed:** The number of operations needed to convert elements inside the range `[i-k, i+k]` can be deduced by `tot-map.getOrDefault(i, 0)`. Which means we need to find the total number of elements that we can increment to `i` and subtract how many `i` are present in `nums`.
5.  **Operation limit:** Limit the number of operations to be no greater than `k`.
6.  **Maximize Frequency:** The optimal frequency for each `i` is the number of original instances of `i` plus the number of other elements converted to `i`, and update the overall answer `ans` accordingly.

This approach is chosen because it systematically considers all possible target values within the range of values in the input array, leveraging binary search for efficiency.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **`int[] nums`:** The input array of integers.
*   **`int k`:** The maximum number of operations allowed.
*   **`HashMap<Integer, Integer> map`:**  Used to store the frequency of each number in the array.
*   **`Arrays.sort()`:** Used to sort the input array.
*   **Binary Search (`lowerBound`, `upperBound`):** Used to find the first and last indices of elements within a specified range in the sorted array.
*   **Iteration:** The outer loop iterates through possible target values.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    private int lowerBound(int[] arr, int target) {
        int left = 0, right = arr.length;
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (arr[mid] < target) left = mid + 1;
            else right = mid;
        }
        return left;
    }

    private int upperBound(int[] arr, int target) {
        int left = 0, right = arr.length;
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (arr[mid] <= target) left = mid + 1;
            else right = mid;
        }
        return left - 1;
    }


    public int maxFrequency(int[] nums, int k, int numOperations) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int ans = 0;

        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

        for(int v : nums) map.put(v, map.getOrDefault(v, 0) + 1);

        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int l = nums[0];
        int r = nums[n-1];

        for(int i = l; i<=r; i++) {
            int v1 = i-k;
            int v2 = i+k;

            int i1 = lowerBound(nums, v1);
            int i2 = upperBound(nums, v2);

            int tot = Math.max(0, i2-i1+1);
            int cnt = Math.min(numOperations, tot-map.getOrDefault(i, 0));

            ans = Math.max(ans, cnt+map.getOrDefault(i, 0));
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```

1.  **`lowerBound(int[] arr, int target)`:** This function performs binary search to find the index of the *first* element in `arr` that is *greater than or equal to* `target`. Returns the index.
2.  **`upperBound(int[] arr, int target)`:** This function performs binary search to find the index of the *last* element in `arr` that is *less than or equal to* `target`. Returns the index.
3.  **`maxFrequency(int[] nums, int k, int numOperations)`:**
    *   `int n = nums.length;`: Gets the length of the input array.
    *   `int ans = 0;`: Initializes the maximum frequency to 0.
    *   `Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();`:  Creates a HashMap to store the frequencies of each number in `nums`.
    *   `for(int v : nums) map.put(v, map.getOrDefault(v, 0) + 1);`: Calculates the frequency of each element in `nums` and stores it in the `map`.
    *   `Arrays.sort(nums);`: Sorts the input array `nums` in ascending order.
    *   `int l = nums[0];`: Gets the smallest element in `nums`.
    *   `int r = nums[n-1];`: Gets the largest element in `nums`.
    *   `for(int i = l; i<=r; i++) { ... }`: Iterates through all possible target values from the minimum to the maximum value in the array.
        *   `int v1 = i-k;`: Calculates the lower bound for the possible values that can be converted to `i`.
        *   `int v2 = i+k;`: Calculates the upper bound for the possible values that can be converted to `i`.
        *   `int i1 = lowerBound(nums, v1);`: Finds the index of the first element greater than or equal to `v1`.
        *   `int i2 = upperBound(nums, v2);`: Finds the index of the last element less than or equal to `v2`.
        *   `int tot = Math.max(0, i2-i1+1);`: Calculates the total number of elements within the range \[v1, v2].
        *   `int cnt = Math.min(numOperations, tot-map.getOrDefault(i, 0));`: Calculates the number of operations required to convert `tot-map.getOrDefault(i, 0)` elements to `i`. If the number of operations needed is greater than `k`, limit the operations to `k`.
        *   `ans = Math.max(ans, cnt+map.getOrDefault(i, 0));`: Updates `ans` with the maximum frequency.
    *   `return ans;`: Returns the maximum frequency.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:**
    *   `Arrays.sort(nums)`: O(n log n), where n is the length of `nums`.
    *   The loop `for(int v : nums)` has a complexity of O(n).
    *   The loop `for(int i = l; i<=r; i++) { ... }` iterates over the range of numbers in `nums`. Let `R = r - l + 1`. The worst case is R might be significant.
    *   `lowerBound` and `upperBound` are O(log n). They are called `R` times, so O(R log n).

    Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n log n + R log n). Since the prompt guarantees a solution with at most 10^5 numbers in the `nums` array, and `k` has a maximum of 10^5 as well, the range can grow up to a large number. Therefore, we can say that the time complexity is O(max(n log n, R log n)) or simplified to O(R log n).

*   **Space Complexity:**
    *   `HashMap<Integer, Integer> map`: O(n) in the worst case (all elements are distinct).
    *   Auxiliary space used by `Arrays.sort()` can range from O(log n) to O(n) depending on the sorting algorithm used by the specific Java implementation.

    Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(n).
