## Maximum Frequency of an Element After Performing Operations I: Detailed Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to find the maximum possible frequency of an element in a given array `nums` after performing at most `k` operations. Each operation allows us to increment any element of the array by 1.  We want to maximize the number of occurrences of a single element after applying the allowed operations. Note that there is also a numOperations parameter, which is not really needed given the `k` parameter is enough to constrain the operation.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The initial solution isn't efficient due to the nested loop and the unnecessary functions `lowerBound` and `upperBound`. It also uses a `numOperations` parameter that is not needed. It iterates from the smallest element to the largest, searching elements within the `k` range and determining if it is possible to make the number occur more times. This approach has some correctness issues.

A better approach would be to use a sliding window technique after sorting the array. The main idea is:

1.  Sort the input array `nums` in ascending order.
2.  Iterate through the sorted array using a sliding window.
3.  For each window, calculate the total cost (number of operations) required to make all elements in the window equal to the rightmost element (the largest in the current window).
4.  If the total cost is within the allowed `k` operations, update the maximum frequency found so far.
5.  If the total cost exceeds `k`, shrink the window from the left until the cost is within the limit.

This approach is chosen because sorting allows us to efficiently calculate the cost of making all elements equal. The sliding window technique helps us explore all possible subarrays and find the one that can be transformed into a subarray with the maximum frequency of a single element, given the limited number of operations.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `int[] nums`: The input array of integers.
*   **Algorithms:**
    *   **Sorting:** `Arrays.sort()` is used to sort the input array.
    *   **Sliding Window:** A sliding window technique is used to efficiently explore different subarrays.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {

    public int maxFrequency(int[] nums, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int left = 0;
        int right = 0;
        long totalCost = 0;
        int maxFrequency = 0;

        while (right < nums.length) {
            // Expand the window
            totalCost += (long) nums[right];

            // Shrink the window if the cost is too high
            while ((long) nums[right] * (right - left + 1) - totalCost > k) {
                totalCost -= (long) nums[left];
                left++;
            }

            // Update the maximum frequency
            maxFrequency = Math.max(maxFrequency, right - left + 1);
            right++;
        }

        return maxFrequency;
    }
}
```

*   **`maxFrequency(int[] nums, int k)`:** This is the main function that calculates the maximum frequency of an element after performing at most `k` operations.

    *   `Arrays.sort(nums);`: Sorts the input array `nums` in ascending order. This is crucial for the sliding window approach to work efficiently.
    *   `int left = 0;`:  The left pointer of the sliding window.
    *   `int right = 0;`: The right pointer of the sliding window.
    *   `long totalCost = 0;`: Stores the total cost (number of operations) to make all elements within the current window equal to the rightmost element.  Using `long` is crucial to avoid potential integer overflow.
    *   `int maxFrequency = 0;`: Stores the maximum frequency found so far.
    *   `while (right < nums.length)`: The main loop that expands the sliding window.
        *   `totalCost += (long)nums[right];`: Adds the current element to the `totalCost`.
        *   `while ((long) nums[right] * (right - left + 1) - totalCost > k)`: This inner loop shrinks the window from the left if the total cost exceeds `k`. The expression `(long) nums[right] * (right - left + 1)` calculates the cost of making every element in the window (from `left` to `right`) equal to `nums[right]`.  We use `long` to prevent overflow if `nums[right]` is large and `right-left+1` is also large. If this cost exceeds `k`, we shrink the window.
            *   `totalCost -= (long)nums[left];`: Subtracts the leftmost element from the `totalCost` as we are shrinking the window from the left.
            *   `left++;`: Moves the left pointer to the right, effectively shrinking the window.
        *   `maxFrequency = Math.max(maxFrequency, right - left + 1);`: Updates `maxFrequency` with the current window size (frequency).
        *   `right++;`: Moves the right pointer to expand the window.
    *   `return maxFrequency;`: Returns the maximum frequency found.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(N log N), where N is the length of the `nums` array.  This is dominated by the `Arrays.sort()` operation. The sliding window part takes O(N) time in the worst case.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1).  The algorithm uses only a few constant extra variables. Note that the space complexity of `Arrays.sort()` depends on the implementation, but it is often O(log N) or O(1) in practice for primitive types in Java.
