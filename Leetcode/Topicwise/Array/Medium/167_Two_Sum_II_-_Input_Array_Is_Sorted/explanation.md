## Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted: Detailed Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The "Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted" problem asks us to find two numbers in a *sorted* array that add up to a specific target value. The problem requires us to return the *indices* of these two numbers (1-indexed).  Crucially, there is guaranteed to be exactly one solution, and we cannot use the same element twice.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The most efficient approach leverages the fact that the input array is *sorted*. This allows us to use a binary search algorithm for a faster lookup.

The basic idea is:

1.  **Iterate through the array:** For each number `numbers[i]` in the array, consider it as one of the two numbers that sum to the target.
2.  **Find the complement:** Calculate the value `val` needed to reach the target (i.e., `val = target - numbers[i]`).
3.  **Search for the complement:**  Use binary search to efficiently find `val` in the remaining portion of the array.
4.  **Check and return:** If `val` is found at index `ind`, and the indices `i` and `ind` are different, return the 1-indexed indices `{i+1, ind+1}`. If the binary search finds the same element, there is a edge case that we can handle. The question states we cannot use the same element twice, so we can increment `i` and check if `numbers[i]==numbers[i+1]`, if it is true, then we have found two identical numbers which sum up to the target.

Why use binary search? Because the array is sorted. Binary search provides logarithmic time complexity for searching, which is significantly faster than a linear search, especially for larger arrays.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `int[]`: The input array of sorted integers.
*   **Algorithms:**
    *   **Binary Search:** The core algorithm used to efficiently search for the complement of each number in the array.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    private int bs(int[] arr , int tar)
    {
        int l = 0;
        int r = arr.length-1;
        while(l<=r)
        {
            int m = (l+r)/2;
            if(arr[m]==tar) return m;
            if(arr[m]<tar) l = m+1;
            else r = m-1;
        }
        return -1;
    }
    public int[] twoSum(int[] numbers, int target) {
        for(int i = 0 ; i < numbers.length ; i++)
        {
            int val = target - numbers[i];
            int ind = bs(numbers , val);
            if(ind != -1)
            {
                if(ind != i) return new int[]{i+1 , ind+1};
                else if(i+1 < numbers.length && numbers[i]==numbers[i+1]) return new int[]{i+1 , i+2};
            }
        }
        return new int[]{};
    }
}
```

*   **`bs(int[] arr, int tar)` function:** This is a standard binary search implementation.
    *   `int l = 0;`: Initializes the left pointer `l` to the beginning of the array.
    *   `int r = arr.length - 1;`: Initializes the right pointer `r` to the end of the array.
    *   `while (l <= r)`:  Continues the search as long as the left pointer is less than or equal to the right pointer.
    *   `int m = (l + r) / 2;`:  Calculates the middle index `m`.
    *   `if (arr[m] == tar) return m;`:  If the element at the middle index is equal to the target `tar`, the index `m` is returned.
    *   `if (arr[m] < tar) l = m + 1;`: If the element at the middle index is less than the target, the left pointer is moved to `m + 1` to search in the right half of the array.
    *   `else r = m - 1;`: If the element at the middle index is greater than the target, the right pointer is moved to `m - 1` to search in the left half of the array.
    *   `return -1;`: If the target is not found, -1 is returned.

*   **`twoSum(int[] numbers, int target)` function:**
    *   `for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++)`:  This loop iterates through each element of the `numbers` array.
    *   `int val = target - numbers[i];`:  Calculates the complement `val` needed to reach the `target`.
    *   `int ind = bs(numbers, val);`: Performs a binary search for `val` in the `numbers` array using the `bs` function.
    *   `if (ind != -1)`: Checks if the binary search found the complement.
        *   `if (ind != i) return new int[]{i + 1, ind + 1};`: If the index of the found complement is not the same as the current index `i`, it means we have found two distinct numbers that sum to the target. The 1-indexed indices are returned.
          * `else if(i+1 < numbers.length && numbers[i]==numbers[i+1]) return new int[]{i+1 , i+2};`: This is to handle the edge case when the result of binary search is the same index as the index of the element we are currently iterating over. The only possible scenario for this to happen is that `numbers[i]` is the same as `val`. For example, if `numbers` array is `[3,3,4]` and `target` is `6`, then when `i` is `0`, `val` is `6 - 3 = 3`. Binary search will return `0`, but we cannot use the same element twice, so we can check if `numbers[i]==numbers[i+1]`. If it is true, then return `i+1` and `i+2`.
    *   `return new int[]{};`: If no solution is found, an empty array is returned.  This should not happen according to the problem constraints.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n log n)
    *   The `for` loop iterates `n` times (where `n` is the length of the `numbers` array).
    *   Inside the loop, the `bs` (binary search) function takes O(log n) time.
    *   Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n * log n).

*   **Space Complexity:** O(1)
    *   The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space for variables like `l`, `r`, `m`, `val`, and `ind`. It does not create any data structures that scale with the input size. Therefore, the space complexity is O(1).
