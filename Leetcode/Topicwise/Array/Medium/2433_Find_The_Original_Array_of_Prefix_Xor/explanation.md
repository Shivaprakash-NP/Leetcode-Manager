## LeetCode "Find The Original Array of Prefix Xor" - Solution Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem states that we are given an array `pref`, which represents the prefix XOR array of another array, let's call it `arr`. The prefix XOR array is defined as `pref[i] = arr[0] ^ arr[1] ^ ... ^ arr[i]`. The goal is to find and return the original array `arr`.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea behind the solution relies on the properties of the XOR operation.  Specifically, we can use the property that `A ^ A = 0` and `A ^ 0 = A`.

Let's consider how the prefix XOR array is constructed:

*   `pref[0] = arr[0]`
*   `pref[1] = arr[0] ^ arr[1]`
*   `pref[2] = arr[0] ^ arr[1] ^ arr[2]`
*   ...
*   `pref[i] = arr[0] ^ arr[1] ^ ... ^ arr[i]`

We can derive `arr` from `pref` using the following logic:

*   `arr[0] = pref[0]` (since `pref[0]` is simply the first element of the original array)
*   For `i > 0`,  `arr[i] = pref[i] ^ pref[i-1]`. This is because:

```
pref[i] = arr[0] ^ arr[1] ^ ... ^ arr[i-1] ^ arr[i]
pref[i-1] = arr[0] ^ arr[1] ^ ... ^ arr[i-1]

pref[i] ^ pref[i-1] = (arr[0] ^ arr[1] ^ ... ^ arr[i-1] ^ arr[i]) ^ (arr[0] ^ arr[1] ^ ... ^ arr[i-1])
                  = arr[i]  (because all the arr[0] to arr[i-1] will XOR with themselves and become zero).
```

This approach is chosen because it directly utilizes the mathematical properties of XOR to efficiently reconstruct the original array from its prefix XOR array.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:** An integer array `ans` is used to store the result (the original array).
*   **Algorithms:** The core algorithm uses the XOR operation to calculate each element of the original array based on the prefix XOR array. It is a linear scan and XOR operation.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] findArray(int[] pref) {
        int[] ans = new int[pref.length]; // 1. Create an array 'ans' of the same length as 'pref' to store the original array.
        ans[0] = pref[0]; // 2. The first element of the original array is the same as the first element of the prefix XOR array.
        for(int i = 1 ; i<ans.length ; i++) { // 3. Iterate through the rest of the elements of the prefix XOR array, starting from the second element.
            ans[i] = pref[i]^pref[i-1]; // 4. Calculate each element of the original array using the XOR operation: ans[i] = pref[i] ^ pref[i-1].
        }
        return ans; // 5. Return the reconstructed original array.
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `int[] ans = new int[pref.length];`: An integer array named `ans` is initialized with the same length as the input `pref` array. This array will store the reconstructed original array.

2.  `ans[0] = pref[0];`: The first element of the original array `ans` is assigned the value of the first element of the prefix XOR array `pref`. This is because, by definition, the first element of the prefix XOR array is the same as the first element of the original array.

3.  `for(int i = 1 ; i<ans.length ; i++) { ... }`: A `for` loop iterates from the second element (index 1) to the last element of the `ans` array.

4.  `ans[i] = pref[i]^pref[i-1];`: Inside the loop, each element `ans[i]` of the original array is calculated by taking the XOR of the corresponding element `pref[i]` and the previous element `pref[i-1]` from the prefix XOR array. As explained in the "Approach" section, this operation effectively extracts the value of the i-th element of the original array.

5.  `return ans;`:  Finally, the function returns the `ans` array, which now contains the reconstructed original array.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the `pref` array. The algorithm iterates through the array once.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(n), because we create a new array `ans` of the same size as the input array `pref`.
