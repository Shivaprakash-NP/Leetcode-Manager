## Minimum Number of Operations to Make All Array Elements Equal to 1

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks for the minimum number of operations required to make all elements of an integer array equal to 1. In a single operation, you can choose two adjacent elements `nums[i]` and `nums[i+1]` and replace `nums[i+1]` with their greatest common divisor (GCD). If it's impossible to make all elements equal to 1, return -1.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea revolves around finding GCDs and strategically applying operations.

1.  **Count Existing Ones:** Initially, we count the number of 1s already present in the array. If there are `k` ones, we need `n - k` operations to make the rest of the elements 1. This is because we can bring these existing ones to any index by repeatedly taking the GCD with adjacent elements.

2.  **Early Exit (Adjacent GCD = 1):** We check if the GCD of any adjacent pair is 1.  If so, we can make the entire array 1 in `n` operations. For example: Consider `[a,b]` where `gcd(a,b)=1`. We can change it to `[a,1]`, where a can be changed to 1 by repeatedly applying GCD operations with `1` if the rest of the array elements are converted into `1` and positioned next to `a`. Therefore `n` operations would be required.

3.  **Finding the Shortest Subarray with GCD = 1:**  If we can't immediately make the array all ones from adjacent values, then we must seek the *shortest subarray* whose GCD is 1.  If we can find such a subarray, say of length `len`, we can make one element 1 in `len - 1` operations. Now with this one, we can propagate it throughout the entire array as follows:  To convert the remaining `n-1` elements we would need additional `n-1` operations. Hence, total number of operations would be `len-1+n-1`.

4.  **Impossible Case:** If no such subarray exists (meaning it's impossible to obtain a 1), we return -1.

Why this approach?  The GCD operation is idempotent; once you have a 1, you can spread it to any adjacent element. Finding the shortest subarray is crucial because each GCD operation combines two elements, and we want to minimize the number of these combinations.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:** Primarily, we use an integer array (`nums`).
*   **Algorithms:**
    *   **GCD (Greatest Common Divisor):** The Euclidean algorithm for computing the GCD is fundamental.
    *   **Iteration/Looping:**  We iterate through the array multiple times.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int gcd(int a, int b) {
        while (b != 0) {
            int temp = b;
            b = a % b;
            a = temp;
        }
        return a;
    }
    public int minOperations(int[] nums) {
        int o = 0;
        int n = nums.length;

        for(int v : nums) if(v == 1) o++;
        if(o>0) return n-o;

        for(int i = 0 ; i<nums.length-1 ; i++) {
            if(gcd(nums[i] , nums[i+1]) == 1) return nums.length;
        }

        int minlen = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for(int i = 0 ; i <n ; i++) {
            int g = nums[i];
            for(int j = i+1 ; j<n ; j++) {
                g = gcd(g , nums[j]);
                if(g == 1) {
                    minlen = Math.min(minlen , j-i+1);
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return (minlen == Integer.MAX_VALUE)?-1:(minlen-1+n-1);
    }
}
```

*   **`gcd(int a, int b)`:**
    *   This function implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of two integers `a` and `b`.
    *   It iteratively updates `a` and `b` until `b` becomes 0. The final value of `a` is the GCD.

*   **`minOperations(int[] nums)`:**
    *   `int o = 0;`: Initializes a counter `o` to store the number of elements equal to 1.
    *   `int n = nums.length;`: Stores the length of the array in `n`.
    *   `for(int v : nums) if(v == 1) o++;`: Iterates through the array and increments `o` for each element equal to 1.
    *   `if(o>0) return n-o;`: If there's at least one '1' in the array, it returns `n - o`, which is the number of operations needed to make all elements 1.
    *   `for(int i = 0 ; i<nums.length-1 ; i++) {if(gcd(nums[i] , nums[i+1]) == 1) return nums.length;}`: Checks for adjacent elements with GCD 1. If it finds any, it returns `n` indicating `n` operations is enough.
    *   `int minlen = Integer.MAX_VALUE;`: Initializes `minlen` to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` to store the length of the shortest subarray with GCD 1.
    *   The nested loop (`for(int i = 0 ; i <n ; i++) { ... for(int j = i+1 ; j<n ; j++) { ... }}`) iterates through all possible subarrays:
        *   `int g = nums[i];`: Initializes `g` with the first element of the subarray.
        *   `g = gcd(g , nums[j]);`: Calculates the GCD of `g` and the next element in the subarray.
        *   `if(g == 1) { minlen = Math.min(minlen , j-i+1); break; }`: If the GCD becomes 1, it updates `minlen` with the length of the current subarray (`j - i + 1`) and breaks the inner loop since we found the shortest subarray that generates a 1.
    *   `return (minlen == Integer.MAX_VALUE)?-1:(minlen-1+n-1);`: If `minlen` remains `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, it means no subarray with GCD 1 was found, so it returns -1. Otherwise, it returns `minlen - 1 + n - 1`, representing the minimum number of operations.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:**
    *   The `gcd` function has a time complexity of O(log(min(a, b))), where a and b are the input integers.
    *   Counting existing ones takes O(n) time.
    *   The adjacent GCD check takes O(n * log(minVal)) time where minVal is minimum of the two numbers.
    *   Finding the shortest subarray with GCD 1 has a nested loop, resulting in O(n^2) iterations. Inside the inner loop, the `gcd` function is called, contributing O(log(minVal)) per GCD calculation. So, the worst-case complexity of finding the shortest subarray is O(n^2 * log(minVal)). Where minVal represents the minimum value of the array.
    *   Therefore, the overall time complexity is dominated by the nested loop: **O(n^2 * log(minVal))**.

*   **Space Complexity:**
    *   The `gcd` function uses constant space.
    *   The `minOperations` function uses a few integer variables (`o`, `n`, `minlen`, `g`, `i`, `j`).
    *   Therefore, the overall space complexity is **O(1)** (constant).
