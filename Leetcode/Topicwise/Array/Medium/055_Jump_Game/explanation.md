## Jump Game Problem Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The "Jump Game" problem asks us to determine if it's possible to reach the last index of an array, given that each element in the array represents the maximum jump length from that position. We start at the first index (index 0).

For example, if `nums = [2,3,1,1,4]`, we start at index 0 with a jump length of 2. We can jump to index 1 or index 2. If `nums = [3,2,1,0,4]`, we start at index 0 with a jump length of 3. We can jump to index 1, 2, or 3. If at any point, the maximum jump length is 0 and we are not at the last index, we will get stuck and cannot reach the end.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The key idea is to maintain a `max` variable, which represents the farthest index we can reach so far. We iterate through the array, and at each index `i`, we check if `i` is reachable (i.e., `i <= max`). If `i` is not reachable, it means we're stuck, and we can't reach the end of the array, so we return `false`.

If `i` is reachable, we update `max` with the farthest we can reach from the current index `i` (i.e., `max = Math.max(max, i + nums[i])`). We use `Math.max()` to make sure we keep track of the largest possible reachable index encountered so far.

Why this approach?  This approach is based on the "greedy" paradigm. At each step, we try to maximize our reach, as the maximum possible reach gives us the best chance of reaching the end. We don't need to explore all possible jump combinations (which would be much less efficient) because simply tracking the maximum reachable position is enough to determine whether we can reach the end or not. The logic is that if the max reach keeps growing, we will eventually reach the end, and if at any point our max reach falls behind, we will get stuck.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structure:** Integer array `nums`.
*   **Algorithm:** Greedy. We greedily update the maximum reachable index at each position.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canJump(int[] nums) {
        int max = 0; // Initialize max reachable index to 0
        for(int i = 0 ; i<nums.length ; i++)
        {
            if(i>max) return false; // If current index is beyond max reachable index, return false
            max = Math.max(max , i + nums[i]); // Update max reachable index
        }
        return true; // If we reach the end, return true
    }
}
```

1.  **`int max = 0;`**:  We initialize `max` to 0. This represents the farthest index we can reach from the starting position (index 0).

2.  **`for(int i = 0 ; i<nums.length ; i++)`**: We iterate through the `nums` array.

3.  **`if(i>max) return false;`**:  This is the crucial check. If the current index `i` is greater than the `max` reachable index, it means we cannot reach this index. Therefore, we cannot reach the end of the array, and we return `false`.

4.  **`max = Math.max(max , i + nums[i]);`**: If the current index `i` *is* reachable (i.e., `i <= max`), we update `max`. `i + nums[i]` represents the farthest index we can reach from the current index `i`. We take the `Math.max` of the current `max` and `i + nums[i]` to ensure we always have the farthest reachable index.

5.  **`return true;`**: If the loop completes without returning `false`, it means we were able to reach every index in the array up to the end. Thus, we can reach the end, and we return `true`.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the `nums` array. We iterate through the array once.

*   **Space Complexity:** O(1). We only use a constant amount of extra space (the `max` variable).
