## LeetCode Problem: Apply Operations to Make All Array Elements Equal to Zero - Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to determine if it's possible to make all elements of a given array `nums` equal to zero by applying a specific operation repeatedly. The operation involves selecting a subarray of length `k` and subtracting the *same* value from each element in that subarray. The value to subtract can be different for each operation. We need to return `true` if it's possible to make all elements zero, and `false` otherwise.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is to simulate the operations greedily from left to right.  Since we must subtract the same value from all elements in a subarray of length `k`, we can process the array element by element.  At each index `i`, we check if the accumulated subtractions (represented by `sum`) are greater than the current element `nums[i]`. If it is, it's impossible to make this element zero, so we return `false`.  Otherwise, we subtract the accumulated subtractions `sum` from `nums[i]` (representing the value we subtract from the subarray starting at index `i` if necessary) and then add the result to the accumulated subtractions `sum`. The crucial part is that once the subarray of length `k` that started at index `i - k + 1` ends (i.e., `i >= k - 1`), the contribution from that subarray should be removed from the total subtractions `sum`.  This ensures that `sum` always represents the total subtraction affecting the current element at index `i`.

The greedy approach works because if we can't make an element zero at its position, there is no way to change that by looking ahead. We *must* reduce it at its own index if needed.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:** The algorithm primarily uses the input array `nums` itself. We are modifying the array in-place, so it acts as both input and working memory to a certain extent.
*   **Algorithms:** The algorithm is essentially a greedy simulation. It iterates through the array once, making decisions locally at each step based on the current state of the accumulated subtractions.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean checkArray(int[] nums, int k) {
        int sum = 0;
        int n = nums.length;
        for(int i = 0 ; i<n ; i++) {
            if(sum > nums[i]) return false;
            nums[i]-=sum;
            sum+=nums[i];
            if(i >= k-1) sum -= nums[i-k+1];
        }
        return sum == 0;
    }
}
```

1.  **`class Solution { ... }`:**  Defines the `Solution` class containing the `checkArray` method.

2.  **`public boolean checkArray(int[] nums, int k) {`:** Declares the `checkArray` method, which takes an integer array `nums` and an integer `k` as input and returns a boolean indicating whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero.

3.  **`int sum = 0;`:** Initializes an integer variable `sum` to 0. This variable will keep track of the accumulated subtractions that are affecting the current element being processed.

4.  **`int n = nums.length;`:** Stores the length of the `nums` array in the variable `n`.

5.  **`for(int i = 0 ; i<n ; i++) {`:** Starts a loop that iterates through each element of the `nums` array.

6.  **`if(sum > nums[i]) return false;`:** Checks if the accumulated subtractions `sum` are greater than the current element `nums[i]`. If it is, it means we cannot reduce `nums[i]` to zero or a non-negative value, even after applying all the accumulated subtractions. Hence, the method returns `false`.

7.  **`nums[i]-=sum;`:**  This is the core part of the greedy simulation. We are subtracting the accumulated sum from current element.
    For example, `nums[i] = 5` and `sum = 2` becomes `nums[i] = 3`. This means to reduce the current element at `i` to zero, we need to subtract 3 from the subarray starting at `i`.

8.  **`sum+=nums[i];`:** After subtracting the accumulated subtractions from the current number `nums[i]`, the remainder `nums[i]` is the number we need to subtract from subarray of length `k` starting at the current index `i`. We add this remainder to the total `sum`, because these subtractions will affect the next `k-1` elements.

9.  **`if(i >= k-1) sum -= nums[i-k+1];`:** This is the crucial step where we remove the contribution of subtractions from previously started subarray.  Once we reach an index `i` that is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, it means that the subarray that started at index `i - k + 1` is no longer affecting the elements we're currently processing.  Therefore, we subtract the amount that was initially subtracted from the subarray from our `sum`. `nums[i - k + 1]` holds the amount subtracted from that subarray.

10. **`return sum == 0;`:** After the loop finishes, the method returns `true` if the accumulated sum `sum` is 0. If `sum` is 0, it means we have correctly accounted for all subtractions and all elements of the `nums` array can be reduced to zero. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** The code iterates through the array `nums` only once, so the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the array.

*   **Space Complexity:** The code uses a constant amount of extra space (only the `sum`, `n`, and `i` variables). It modifies the array in-place. Therefore, the space complexity is O(1).
