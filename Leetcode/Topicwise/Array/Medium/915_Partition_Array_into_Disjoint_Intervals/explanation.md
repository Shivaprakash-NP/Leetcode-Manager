Okay, let's break down the provided Java code for the LeetCode problem "Partition Array into Disjoint Intervals."

## Partition Array into Disjoint Intervals

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to find the smallest index `i` such that all elements to the left of `i` (inclusive) are less than or equal to all elements to the right of `i+1` (inclusive). In other words, we need to partition the array into two non-empty subarrays, `left` and `right`, such that every element in `left` is less than or equal to every element in `right`.  We need to return the length of the left subarray, which is `i + 1`.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is to iterate through the array and maintain two key pieces of information:

*   `lmax`: The maximum value in the *left* partition so far. Initially, this is just the first element of the array.
*   `omax`: The overall maximum value encountered from the beginning of the array to the current index `i`.

We iterate from the second element of the array (`i = 1`). For each element `nums[i]`, we update `omax` to be the maximum of its current value and `nums[i]`. If we find that `nums[i]` is *smaller* than `lmax`, it means that `nums[i]` should belong to the left partition. To incorporate it into the left partition, we extend the left partition to include index `i`. The trick here is that, since we extended the left partition, the old `lmax` might no longer be a suitable upper bound for the left partition. Thus, we update `lmax` to be the new maximum value of the potentially extended left partition, which we've been tracking with `omax`.  Also, `ans` which originally stores the potential partition index is updated to the newly extended partition index, `i`.

This approach is chosen because it efficiently identifies the partition point by maintaining running maximums and making local adjustments as needed.  It avoids needing to scan subarrays repeatedly, leading to a linear time complexity.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:** We primarily use integer variables to store the maximums and the index of the partition. No complex data structures like arrays or lists are needed.
*   **Algorithms:**  The algorithm is essentially a single loop with comparisons and updates. It uses the `Math.max()` function to find the maximum of two numbers.  It's a greedy approach, extending the left partition when necessary based on the current element.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int partitionDisjoint(int[] nums) {
        int lmax = nums[0]; // Initialize lmax with the first element. Represents the maximum value in the left partition (initially only nums[0]).
        int omax = nums[0]; // Initialize omax with the first element. Represents the overall maximum value seen so far.
        int ans = 0;      // Initialize ans to 0. Stores the index of the potential partition.

        for(int i = 1 ; i < nums.length ; ++i) {
            omax = Math.max(omax , nums[i]); // Update omax to be the maximum of the current omax and nums[i].

            if(nums[i] < lmax) {
                ans = i;           // Update the potential partition index because nums[i] should belong to the left partition.
                lmax = omax;       // The old lmax is no longer suitable, so update lmax to the overall maximum we've seen so far
                                     // because we have to extend the left partition.
            }
        }
        return ans+1; // Return the length of the left partition.
    }
}
```

*   **`int lmax = nums[0];`**:  Initializes `lmax` (left max) to the first element of the array. This represents the maximum value in the initial left partition, which initially only contains the first element.
*   **`int omax = nums[0];`**:  Initializes `omax` (overall max) to the first element of the array. This will keep track of the maximum value encountered as we iterate through the array.
*   **`int ans = 0;`**: Initializes `ans` which will hold the index of where we should split the array such that all elements to the left of `ans` (inclusive) are less than or equal to all elements to the right of `ans+1` (inclusive).
*   **`for(int i = 1 ; i < nums.length ; ++i)`**: This loop iterates through the array starting from the second element (index 1).
*   **`omax = Math.max(omax , nums[i]);`**: In each iteration, `omax` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the current element `nums[i]`.
*   **`if(nums[i] < lmax)`**: This is the crucial condition. If the current element `nums[i]` is less than `lmax`, it means that `nums[i]` should ideally be part of the left partition. This means we have to extend the left partition to include index `i`.
*   **`ans = i;`**: If the condition is true, it updates `ans` to the new partition index `i`.
*   **`lmax = omax;`**:  We also update `lmax` to `omax`. Because we are extending the left partition, the old `lmax` may no longer be a valid upper bound for the left partition, so we set it to the new overall max.
*   **`return ans+1;`**: Finally, the function returns `ans + 1`, which is the length of the left partition (the problem asks for the length, not the index).

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the array. The code iterates through the array once in a single `for` loop. Inside the loop, the operations (comparisons, `Math.max()`, assignments) take constant time.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1). The code uses a fixed number of integer variables (`lmax`, `omax`, `ans`, `i`) regardless of the input array size. Therefore, the space complexity is constant.
