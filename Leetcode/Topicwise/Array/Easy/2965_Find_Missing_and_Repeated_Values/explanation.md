## Find Missing and Repeated Values - Detailed Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem presents a square grid (n x n) containing integers from 1 to n<sup>2</sup>, with exactly one number repeated and one number missing. The task is to identify these two numbers: the repeated number and the missing number.  We need to return an array of length 2: `[repeated, missing]`.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is to leverage mathematical formulas to calculate the sum and sum of squares of numbers from 1 to n<sup>2</sup>.  We then iterate through the grid, calculating the actual sum and sum of squares of the numbers present.  The differences between the expected and actual sums/sums of squares allow us to formulate two equations with two unknowns (the repeated number 'r' and the missing number 'm').  Solving these equations reveals the repeated and missing values.

The approach is chosen for its efficiency: it avoids using extra space like a hash table or boolean array to track the presence of numbers. Instead, it utilizes mathematical properties to directly compute the desired values. This makes it a very space-efficient solution.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:**  We use a simple `int[]` array of size 2 to store the result.
*   **Algorithms:** This solution primarily uses algebraic manipulation and iterative summation.  It leverages known mathematical formulas for the sum and sum of squares of the first 'n' natural numbers.  Specifically, these formulas are:
    *   Sum of first n natural numbers: n*(n+1)/2
    *   Sum of squares of first n natural numbers: n*(n+1)*(2n+1)/6

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] findMissingAndRepeatedValues(int[][] grid) {
        long n = grid.length * grid.length; // Calculate n^2
        long ns = (n * (n + 1)) / 2; // Expected sum of numbers from 1 to n^2
        long nss = (n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1)) / 6; // Expected sum of squares of numbers from 1 to n^2
        long as = 0; // Actual sum of numbers in the grid
        long ass = 0; // Actual sum of squares of numbers in the grid

        for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
            for (int v : grid[i]) {
                as += v; // Accumulate the sum of numbers in the grid
                ass += (long) v * v; // Accumulate the sum of squares of numbers in the grid. Casting to long to avoid overflow
            }
        }

        long x = as - ns;  // x = Repeated - Missing (r - m)
        long y = ass - nss; // y = Repeated^2 - Missing^2 (r^2 - m^2)

        long s = y / x; // s = Repeated + Missing (r + m) because y/x = (r^2-m^2) / (r-m) = (r+m)(r-m) / (r-m) = r+m

        int[] ans = new int[2];
        ans[0] = (int) ((s + x) / 2); // Repeated = (s + x) / 2  because (r + m) + (r - m) = 2r => r = (s+x)/2
        ans[1] = (int) ((s - x) / 2); // Missing = (s - x) / 2 because (r + m) - (r - m) = 2m => m = (s-x)/2
        return ans;
    }
}
```

**Line-by-line Explanation:**

1.  `long n = grid.length * grid.length;`: Calculates n<sup>2</sup>, the total number of elements if there were no repetitions or missing values. It is stored as a `long` to prevent potential integer overflow when calculating `n * n`.
2.  `long ns = (n * (n + 1)) / 2;`: Calculates the expected sum of numbers from 1 to n<sup>2</sup> using the formula for the sum of the first 'n' natural numbers. This is the sum we *should* have if no numbers were repeated or missing.
3.  `long nss = (n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1)) / 6;`: Calculates the expected sum of the *squares* of numbers from 1 to n<sup>2</sup> using the corresponding formula. Again, this is what we expect if no numbers were repeated or missing.
4.  `long as = 0;`: Initializes a variable to store the actual sum of the numbers present in the grid.
5.  `long ass = 0;`: Initializes a variable to store the actual sum of the squares of the numbers present in the grid.
6.  `for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) { ... }`:  Outer loop iterates through the rows of the grid.
7.  `for (int v : grid[i]) { ... }`: Inner loop iterates through each element `v` in the current row.
8.  `as += v;`: Adds the current element `v` to the actual sum `as`.
9.  `ass += (long) v * v;`:  Adds the square of the current element `v` to the actual sum of squares `ass`. The cast to `(long)` is crucial to prevent potential integer overflow when `v * v` is calculated.
10. `long x = as - ns;`: Calculates the difference between the actual sum (`as`) and the expected sum (`ns`). This difference represents `Repeated - Missing` (r - m).  If `r` is the repeated number and `m` is the missing number, `x = r - m`.
11. `long y = ass - nss;`: Calculates the difference between the actual sum of squares (`ass`) and the expected sum of squares (`nss`).  This represents `Repeated^2 - Missing^2` (r<sup>2</sup> - m<sup>2</sup>).
12. `long s = y / x;`:  Divides `y` by `x`.  Since `y = r^2 - m^2 = (r + m)(r - m)` and `x = r - m`, then `y / x = r + m`. So, `s = r + m`.
13. `int[] ans = new int[2];`: Creates an integer array `ans` of size 2 to store the repeated and missing numbers.
14. `ans[0] = (int) ((s + x) / 2);`: Calculates the repeated number `r` using the equations `s = r + m` and `x = r - m`. Adding these gives `s + x = 2r`, so `r = (s + x) / 2`. The result is cast to `int` before storing it in `ans[0]`.
15. `ans[1] = (int) ((s - x) / 2);`: Calculates the missing number `m` using the same equations. Subtracting `x` from `s` gives `s - x = 2m`, so `m = (s - x) / 2`. The result is cast to `int` before storing it in `ans[1]`.
16. `return ans;`: Returns the array containing the repeated and missing numbers.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n<sup>2</sup>), where n is the side length of the square grid. This is because we iterate through all elements of the grid to calculate the actual sum and sum of squares.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1). We use a constant amount of extra space to store the intermediate sums, differences, and the result array. The space used does not depend on the size of the input grid.
