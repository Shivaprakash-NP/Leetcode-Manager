## LeetCode: Maximum Average Subarray I - Detailed Solution Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the maximum average value of all contiguous subarrays of size `k` within a given integer array `nums`.  In simpler terms, we need to find the subarray of length `k` that has the largest average.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The most efficient approach to solve this problem is using a **sliding window** technique.  Instead of calculating the average for every possible subarray of size `k` (which would be O(n^2)), we maintain a window of size `k` that slides across the array.  We keep track of the sum of elements within the window. As the window moves, we subtract the element leaving the window and add the element entering the window, updating the sum efficiently. This avoids redundant calculations. This approach is chosen because it significantly reduces the time complexity compared to brute-force approaches.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**  The primary data structure used is an array (`nums`) to store the input numbers.  No other significant data structures are needed because of the sliding window approach.
* **Algorithms:** The core algorithm used is the sliding window technique. This involves iterative traversal and maintaining a running sum.  The `Math.max()` function is used to find the maximum average encountered so far.

**4. Code Walkthrough:**

```java
class Solution {
    public double findMaxAverage(int[] nums, int k) {
        int sum = 0; // Variable to store the current window sum
        double ans = Integer.MIN_VALUE; // Variable to store the maximum average so far, initialized to the smallest possible value.
        int l = 0; // Left pointer of the sliding window

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            sum += nums[i]; // Add the current element to the window sum

            if (i - l + 1 > k) { // Check if the window size exceeds k
                sum -= nums[l++]; // If it exceeds k, remove the element at the left end of the window and move the left pointer.
            }

            if (i - l + 1 == k) { // Check if the window size is exactly k
                ans = Math.max(ans, (double) sum / k); // Calculate and update the maximum average if the window size is k.
            }
        }

        return ans; // Return the maximum average found.
    }
}
```

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`.  The code iterates through the array only once using the sliding window.  All operations within the loop (addition, subtraction, comparison) are constant time O(1).

* **Space Complexity:** O(1). The solution uses a fixed number of variables (`sum`, `ans`, `l`) regardless of the input array size. The space used does not scale with the input size, making it constant space complexity.


In summary, the provided Java code efficiently solves the "Maximum Average Subarray I" problem using a sliding window technique, achieving optimal time complexity of O(n) and constant space complexity O(1).  The code is well-structured and easy to understand, making it a robust and efficient solution.
