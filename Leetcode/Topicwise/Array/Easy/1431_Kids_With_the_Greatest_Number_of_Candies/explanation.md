## LeetCode Problem: Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies - Explained

Here's a detailed explanation of the provided Java code solution to the "Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies" LeetCode problem.

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to determine, for each kid in a group, whether they can have the greatest number of candies among all the kids if they receive a given number of extra candies.  We're given an array `candies` representing the number of candies each kid has, and an integer `extraCandies` representing the number of extra candies each kid can potentially receive.  The output should be a list of booleans, where the i-th boolean indicates whether the i-th kid can have the greatest number of candies after receiving `extraCandies`.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The key idea is to first find the maximum number of candies any kid has initially. Then, for each kid, we check if, after receiving the extra candies, their total candies will be greater than or equal to the maximum number of candies.  If it is, they can potentially have the greatest number of candies; otherwise, they cannot.

This approach is efficient because:

*   It avoids repeated comparisons by finding the maximum candy count first.
*   It directly addresses the problem statement by comparing the potential candy count of each kid with the maximum.
*   The logic is simple and straightforward, making the code easy to understand and maintain.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `int[] candies`:  An array of integers storing the number of candies each kid has.
    *   `ArrayList<Boolean> ans`: A dynamic array (list) used to store the boolean results for each kid.

*   **Algorithms:**
    *   **Iteration:** We iterate through the `candies` array twice. The first iteration is to find the maximum value, and the second is to determine whether adding extra candies would put each kid at or above that maximum.
    *   **Maximum Value Finding:**  We use `Math.max()` to iteratively find the maximum value in the `candies` array.
    *   **Conditional Logic:** We use a ternary operator `(condition) ? value_if_true : value_if_false` to determine the boolean value to add to the result list.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Boolean> kidsWithCandies(int[] candies, int extraCandies) {
        int gt = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for(int v : candies) gt = Math.max(gt , v);
        ArrayList<Boolean> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int i = 0 ; i<candies.length ; i++)
        {
            ans.add((candies[i]+extraCandies >= gt)?true:false);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

1.  **`class Solution { ... }`**: Defines the class `Solution` which will contain our solution method.

2.  **`public List<Boolean> kidsWithCandies(int[] candies, int extraCandies) { ... }`**:
    *   This is the main method that solves the problem. It takes an integer array `candies` and an integer `extraCandies` as input and returns a `List<Boolean>`.

3.  **`int gt = Integer.MIN_VALUE;`**:
    *   Initializes an integer variable `gt` (presumably short for "greatest") to the smallest possible integer value. This variable will store the maximum number of candies among all kids.  Starting with the smallest possible integer ensures that the first element of `candies` will always be greater.

4.  **`for(int v : candies) gt = Math.max(gt , v);`**:
    *   This is a enhanced for loop (for-each loop) that iterates through the `candies` array.
    *   In each iteration, `v` represents the current element in the `candies` array.
    *   `gt = Math.max(gt , v);`:  This line updates `gt` to be the maximum between its current value and the current element `v`. After the loop finishes, `gt` will hold the maximum value in the `candies` array.

5.  **`ArrayList<Boolean> ans = new ArrayList<>();`**:
    *   Creates a new `ArrayList` named `ans` to store the boolean results.  `ArrayList` is used because the size isn't fixed beforehand.

6.  **`for(int i = 0 ; i<candies.length ; i++) { ... }`**:
    *   This is a standard `for` loop that iterates through the `candies` array using an index `i`.

7.  **`ans.add((candies[i]+extraCandies >= gt)?true:false);`**:
    *   This is the core logic of the solution.
    *   `candies[i] + extraCandies`: Calculates the total number of candies the i-th kid would have if they received the extra candies.
    *   `(candies[i] + extraCandies >= gt)`:  This condition checks if the total number of candies for the i-th kid is greater than or equal to the maximum number of candies (`gt`).
    *   `(condition) ? true : false`:  This is a ternary operator. If the condition is true, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.
    *   `ans.add(...)`: Adds the boolean result (either `true` or `false`) to the `ans` list.

8.  **`return ans;`**:
    *   Returns the `ans` list, which contains the boolean results for each kid.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of kids (length of the `candies` array).
    *   The first `for` loop iterates through the `candies` array once to find the maximum, taking O(n) time.
    *   The second `for` loop iterates through the `candies` array again to calculate the boolean values, also taking O(n) time.
    *   Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n) + O(n) = O(n).

*   **Space Complexity:** O(n) in the worst case, where n is the number of kids.
    *   The `ArrayList<Boolean> ans` stores a boolean for each kid, so it can potentially store n elements, leading to O(n) space complexity.  The integer variable `gt` takes constant O(1) space.  Therefore the space complexity is dominated by the size of the result array.
