## LeetCode Problem: Smallest Index With Digit Sum Equal to Index - Explained

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to find the smallest index `i` in an array `nums` such that the sum of the digits of the number at that index (`nums[i]`) is equal to the index `i` itself. If no such index exists, we should return -1.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The problem's description directly suggests the most straightforward approach:

1.  **Iterate:** Loop through the input array `nums` using a `for` loop, keeping track of the index `i`.
2.  **Calculate Digit Sum:** For each index `i`, calculate the sum of the digits of `nums[i]`.  We'll use a helper function `find(int n)` to achieve this.
3.  **Compare:** Check if the calculated digit sum is equal to the index `i`. If it is, we've found our desired index and immediately return it.
4.  **Handle No Match:** If the loop completes without finding a matching index, it means no such index exists in the array. Return -1 in this case.

This approach is chosen because it's simple, direct, and easy to understand.  It aligns perfectly with the problem's requirements, making it an efficient and clear solution. There isn't a need for more complex data structures or algorithms because the problem constraints are relatively small.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:**  The primary data structure is the input array `nums`. We use an integer to store the sum of digits.
*   **Algorithms:** The key algorithm used is a simple iterative loop. Within the loop, we apply the modulo operator (%) and integer division (/) to compute the digit sum.  This is a basic arithmetic algorithm.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    private int find(int n) {
        int sum = 0;
        while(n != 0) {
            sum+=n%10;
            n/=10;
        }
        return sum;
    }
    public int smallestIndex(int[] nums) {
        for(int i = 0 ; i<nums.length ; i++) {
            if(find(nums[i]) == i) return i;
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```

*   **`find(int n)` function:**
    *   **`int sum = 0;`**: Initializes a variable `sum` to 0. This variable will store the sum of the digits of the input number `n`.
    *   **`while(n != 0) { ... }`**: This `while` loop continues as long as the number `n` is not zero.  It's the core part of the digit sum calculation.
    *   **`sum += n % 10;`**: This line calculates the last digit of `n` using the modulo operator (`% 10`) and adds it to the `sum`. For example, if `n` is 123, `n % 10` will be 3, and `sum` will become `sum + 3`.
    *   **`n /= 10;`**: This line removes the last digit from `n` by performing integer division by 10. For example, if `n` is 123, `n /= 10` will make `n` equal to 12.
    *   **`return sum;`**: After the `while` loop finishes (when `n` becomes 0), the function returns the calculated `sum` of the digits.

*   **`smallestIndex(int[] nums)` function:**
    *   **`for(int i = 0 ; i<nums.length ; i++) { ... }`**: This `for` loop iterates through the input array `nums`, from index 0 up to (but not including) `nums.length`. The variable `i` represents the current index.
    *   **`if(find(nums[i]) == i) return i;`**: This line is the core logic of the function.
        *   `find(nums[i])`: Calls the `find()` function to calculate the sum of the digits of the number at the current index `i` in the `nums` array.
        *   `== i`: Compares the calculated digit sum with the current index `i`.
        *   `return i;`: If the digit sum is equal to the index, it means we've found the desired index. The function immediately returns this index `i`.
    *   **`return -1;`**: If the `for` loop completes without finding a matching index (i.e., the `if` condition is never true), the function returns -1, indicating that no such index exists.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:**
    *   The `smallestIndex` function iterates through the `nums` array once, which takes O(n) time, where `n` is the length of the array.
    *   Inside the loop, the `find` function is called for each element. The `find` function's `while` loop iterates a number of times proportional to the number of digits in the input number. In the worst case, where all elements in `nums` have the maximum possible number of digits, the `find` function would take O(log10(k)) where k is the number.
    *   Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n * log10(k)). If we assume the number of digits `k` is relatively small compared to the size of the `nums` array and the problem has not given constraints on values of `nums[i]`, the complexity can be considered O(n).
*   **Space Complexity:**
    *   The `find` function uses a constant amount of extra space to store the `sum` variable. So, it takes O(1) space.
    *   The `smallestIndex` function also uses a constant amount of extra space (the loop variable `i`). So, it also takes O(1) space.
    *   Therefore, the overall space complexity of the solution is O(1).
