## LeetCode Problem: Three Consecutive Odds - Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to determine if an integer array contains at least three consecutive odd numbers. We need to return `true` if such a sequence exists and `false` otherwise.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is to iterate through the array and maintain a counter (`c`) that tracks the number of consecutive odd numbers encountered so far.  For each element, we check if it's odd. If it is, we increment the counter. If it's even, we reset the counter to 0 because the consecutive sequence of odd numbers has been broken. If at any point the counter reaches 3 or more, we know we've found three or more consecutive odds, and we can immediately return `true`. If we finish iterating through the array without the counter ever reaching 3, it means there are no three consecutive odd numbers, and we return `false`. This is a simple and efficient linear-time approach.

The reason this approach is chosen is its simplicity and efficiency.  It directly addresses the problem requirement without needing complex data structures or algorithms.  It's a straightforward linear scan that's easy to understand and implement.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:**  No complex data structures are used. The solution directly operates on the input array (`int[] arr`).
*   **Algorithms:**  The algorithm employed is a simple linear scan (iteration) with a counter to track consecutive odd numbers.  Bitwise AND operator `&` is also used for efficiently checking the odd/even parity of a number.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean threeConsecutiveOdds(int[] arr) {
        int c = 0; // Initialize a counter to track consecutive odd numbers.

        for(int i = 0 ; i < arr.length ; i++) { // Iterate through the array.
            if(c >= 3) return true; // If we've already found three consecutive odds, return true immediately.

            if((arr[i]&1) == 1) c++; // If the current element is odd (bitwise AND with 1 equals 1), increment the counter.
            else c = 0; // If the current element is even, reset the counter to 0.
        }

        return (c>=3)?true:false; // After iterating through the entire array, check if the counter is at least 3. If so, return true; otherwise, return false.  This is a ternary operator equivalent to:
        // if(c>=3) {
        //    return true;
        // } else {
        //    return false;
        // }
    }
}
```

**Explanation of specific parts:**

*   `int c = 0;`: This initializes an integer variable `c` to 0. This variable will store the count of consecutive odd numbers.
*   `for(int i = 0 ; i < arr.length ; i++)`: This is a standard `for` loop that iterates through the input array `arr` from the beginning to the end.
*   `if(c >= 3) return true;`: This is an optimization. If the counter `c` is already greater than or equal to 3, it means we have found at least three consecutive odd numbers, so we can immediately return `true` without checking the rest of the array.
*   `if((arr[i]&1) == 1)`: This is the core logic for checking if a number is odd. The bitwise AND operator `&` is used with 1.  If the least significant bit of `arr[i]` is 1, the result of `arr[i] & 1` will be 1, indicating that the number is odd. If the least significant bit is 0, the result will be 0, indicating that the number is even.
*   `c++;`: If the current number `arr[i]` is odd, we increment the counter `c`.
*   `else c = 0;`: If the current number `arr[i]` is even, the consecutive sequence of odd numbers is broken, so we reset the counter `c` to 0.
*   `return (c>=3)?true:false;`: After the loop finishes, this line checks if the counter `c` is greater than or equal to 3.  If it is, it returns `true`, indicating that the array contains at least three consecutive odd numbers. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input array.  The code iterates through the array once in the worst case.  The `if(c >= 3)` statement provides early termination but does not change the worst-case time complexity, because in the worst case, it still needs to scan the whole array.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1).  The code uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the size of the input array.  Only a single integer variable `c` is used.
