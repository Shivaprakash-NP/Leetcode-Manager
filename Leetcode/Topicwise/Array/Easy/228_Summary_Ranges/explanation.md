## Summary Ranges - Java Solution Explanation

Here's a detailed explanation of the provided Java code for the LeetCode "Summary Ranges" problem.

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The "Summary Ranges" problem asks us to take a sorted integer array `nums` without duplicates and return a list of strings representing the smallest sorted list of ranges that cover all the numbers in the array exactly. That is, each element of `nums` is covered by exactly one of the ranges, and there is no integer `x` such that `x` is in one of the ranges but not in `nums`.

For example:

*   Input: `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,7]`
*   Output: `["0->2","4->5","7"]`

*   Input: `nums = [0,2,3,4,6,8,9]`
*   Output: `["0","2->4","6","8->9"]`

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is to iterate through the sorted array and identify continuous ranges.  We keep track of the start of a potential range (`l`).  For each element, we check if it's consecutive to the previous element.

*   If it *is* consecutive, we continue iterating, extending the potential range.
*   If it *isn't* consecutive, it means the current range has ended.  We then format the range as a string (either "start->end" if the range contains more than one element, or "start" if it's just a single element) and add it to the result list. We then update the start `l` to the current number to start a new range.

Finally, after the loop finishes, we need to handle the last range, which may or may not have been added yet. We apply the same string formatting logic to the last range.

This approach is chosen because it's a straightforward, linear traversal of the array, making it efficient.  It exploits the sorted property of the input array to easily identify consecutive ranges.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `ArrayList<String>`: This is used to store the resulting list of range strings.  It's a dynamic array, so it can grow as needed.
*   **Algorithms:**
    *   **Linear Traversal:** The code iterates through the array once using a `for` loop. This is the fundamental algorithmic technique used.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> summaryRanges(int[] nums) {
        ArrayList<String> val = new ArrayList<>(); // Initialize an empty list to store the results
        if(nums.length == 0) return val; // Handle the empty array case, return an empty list

        int l = nums[0]; // Initialize 'l' to the first element of the array. 'l' marks the start of a range

        for(int i = 1 ; i<nums.length ; i++) // Iterate through the array starting from the second element
        {
            if(nums[i] != nums[i-1]+1) // Check if the current element is not consecutive to the previous element
            {
                if(l == nums[i-1]) val.add(String.valueOf(l)); // If the range contains only one element, add it as a string
                else val.add(l+"->"+nums[i-1]); // If the range contains more than one element, add it as "start->end"

                l = nums[i]; // Update 'l' to the current element, starting a new range
            }
        }

        if(l==nums[nums.length-1]) val.add(l+""); // Handle the last range: if it has only one element
        else val.add(l+"->"+nums[nums.length-1]); // Handle the last range: if it has more than one element
        return val; // Return the list of range strings
    }
}
```

**Detailed Explanation:**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   `ArrayList<String> val = new ArrayList<>();`:  Creates an empty `ArrayList` called `val` to store the resulting strings representing the ranges.
    *   `if(nums.length == 0) return val;`: Handles the edge case where the input array is empty.  If it's empty, it immediately returns the empty `val` list.
    *   `int l = nums[0];`: Initializes `l` (left) to the first element of the array (`nums[0]`). `l` will store the starting value of the current range.

2.  **Iteration:**
    *   `for(int i = 1 ; i<nums.length ; i++)`:  Iterates through the array, starting from the second element (`i = 1`).
    *   `if(nums[i] != nums[i-1]+1)`: This is the crucial condition.  It checks if the current element `nums[i]` is *not* consecutive to the previous element `nums[i-1]`.  If they are not consecutive, it means the current range has ended.
    *   `if(l == nums[i-1]) val.add(String.valueOf(l));`:  If `l` (the start of the range) is equal to the previous element `nums[i-1]`, it means the range contained only one element.  In this case, we add the value of `l` (converted to a string) to the `val` list.
    *   `else val.add(l+"->"+nums[i-1]);`: If `l` is *not* equal to `nums[i-1]`, it means the range contained more than one element.  In this case, we add the string "l->nums[i-1]" to the `val` list, representing the range from `l` to `nums[i-1]`.
    *   `l = nums[i];`: After adding the range to the `val` list, we update `l` to the current element `nums[i]`. This starts a new range.

3.  **Handling the Last Range:**
    *   `if(l==nums[nums.length-1]) val.add(l+"");`: After the loop has finished, we need to handle the last range. This checks if the last range contained only one element (start equals the last element of `nums`). If so, it adds that element as a string to val.
    *   `else val.add(l+"->"+nums[nums.length-1]);`: Otherwise, it means the last range had more than one element.  It adds the string "l->nums[nums.length-1]" to the `val` list.

4.  **Return:**
    *   `return val;`: Finally, the function returns the `val` list, which now contains the strings representing the summary ranges.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`.  The code iterates through the array once in the `for` loop. All other operations within the loop (comparisons, string concatenations, adding to the ArrayList) take constant time.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1) in the average case, O(n) in the worst case. The space complexity depends on the size of the output list `val`.  In the worst-case scenario (e.g., `nums = [1,3,5,7,9]`), each number forms its own individual range, so the `val` list will contain n strings. String construction also takes O(number of characters in the string). Since the number of ranges will not exceed the number of elements, the space complexity is O(n). The additional space used for variables like `l` and `i` is constant, O(1).
