### 1. Intuition

The problem asks us to validate and categorize coupon codes based on their business line and whether they are active.  Imagine a supermarket chain with different departments (electronics, grocery, etc.) each having its own coupon codes.  This solution acts like a central coupon validator, filtering out inactive codes and invalid code formats, then neatly organizing the valid codes by department before presenting them in a sorted list.


### 2. Approach

The solution uses a three-step approach:

1. **Filtering and Validation:** It iterates through the input arrays (`code`, `businessLine`, `isActive`).  It filters out coupons that are inactive (`isActive[i] == false`) or belong to an unsupported business line. It also uses the `is()` helper function to check if the coupon code itself is valid (contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores).

2. **Categorization:** Valid coupons are categorized by their `businessLine` using a `TreeMap`. A `TreeMap` is used to ensure the business lines are sorted alphabetically (important for a consistent output). Each business line maps to a list of its valid coupon codes.

3. **Sorting and Output:** Finally, the code iterates through the four supported business lines ("electronics", "grocery", "pharmacy", "restaurant"). For each business line, if it has valid coupons, those coupons are sorted alphabetically and appended to the result list `ans`.

### 3. Data Structures

* **`TreeMap<String, List<String>> map`:** This is a crucial data structure. It's a map where the keys are the business lines (strings like "electronics", "grocery"), and the values are lists of strings representing the valid coupon codes for that business line.  The `TreeMap` ensures that the business lines are processed and presented in a lexicographical order.

* **`List<String> ans`:** This list stores the final, sorted list of valid coupon codes, ready to be returned.

* **`List<String> dum`:** This is a temporary list used to create a new list of coupons for each business line upon first encounter.

### 4. Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** O(N log N), where N is the number of coupon codes.  The dominant factor is the sorting of coupon codes within each business line (`Collections.sort()` has O(M log M) complexity for M elements), and in the worst case, all codes could belong to a single business line. The initial iteration is O(N), and the final iteration through the four business lines is O(1).

* **Space Complexity:** O(N) in the worst case. The `TreeMap` could, in the worst-case scenario, store all N coupon codes if all are valid and belong to different business lines.  The `ans` list also takes up space proportional to the number of valid coupon codes, which is at most N.  The temporary `dum` list has a maximum size equal to the largest number of valid codes for a given business line, which doesn't change the overall O(N) space complexity.


**In summary:** This solution efficiently processes a large number of coupon codes, validating them, categorizing them by business line, sorting them within each category, and returning a well-organized list of valid codes.  The use of a `TreeMap` is key to ensuring sorted output and efficient lookups, while careful consideration of space and time complexity makes it an optimized solution.
