## LeetCode Problem: Concatenation of Array - Solution Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem "Concatenation of Array" asks us to take an input array `nums` and create a new array `ans` that is twice the length of `nums`. The `ans` array should contain two copies of the `nums` array concatenated together. For example, if `nums` is `[1, 2, 1]`, then `ans` should be `[1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1]`.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The most straightforward approach is to create a new array `ans` with a length of `2 * n`, where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`.  Then, iterate through the `ans` array, and for each index `i`, assign the value from the `nums` array at index `i % n`.  The modulo operator (`%`) ensures that we loop through the `nums` array twice when filling the `ans` array.  This method avoids needing to create intermediate copies or use more complex array manipulation techniques.

The key idea is using the modulo operator (`%`) to map the indices of the concatenated array `ans` back to the original `nums` array.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structure:** Array. We primarily work with integer arrays.
*   **Algorithm:** The core algorithm is based on a simple iterative approach using a `for` loop and the modulo operator.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] getConcatenation(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] ans = new int[2*n];
        for(int i = 0; i < 2*n ; i++) {
            ans[i] = nums[i%n];
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

*   **`class Solution { ... }`**: This defines the class containing the solution.
*   **`public int[] getConcatenation(int[] nums) { ... }`**: This is the method that takes the input array `nums` and returns the concatenated array.
*   **`int n = nums.length;`**: This line calculates the length of the input array `nums` and stores it in the variable `n`. This avoids repeatedly calling `nums.length` within the loop, improving readability.
*   **`int[] ans = new int[2*n];`**: This creates a new integer array `ans` with a length of `2 * n`. This array will store the concatenated result.
*   **`for(int i = 0; i < 2*n ; i++) { ... }`**: This loop iterates through the `ans` array from index 0 to `2 * n - 1`.
*   **`ans[i] = nums[i%n];`**: This is the core logic of the solution. Inside the loop, for each index `i` in `ans`, it calculates `i % n`. The result of this modulo operation will always be an index within the range of the `nums` array (0 to `n - 1`). This index is then used to access an element from the `nums` array, and that element is assigned to the corresponding index `i` in the `ans` array.  For example:
    *   If `i` is less than `n`, then `i % n` is just `i`, so the first `n` elements of `ans` are the same as the first `n` elements of `nums`.
    *   If `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `i % n` wraps around, effectively copying the `nums` array a second time into the latter half of `ans`.
*   **`return ans;`**: After the loop finishes, the `ans` array now contains the concatenation of `nums` with itself, so the method returns `ans`.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`.  The solution iterates through the `ans` array, which has a length of `2 * n`, once. The operations inside the loop (modulo and assignment) take constant time. Therefore, the overall time complexity is linear with respect to the length of the input array.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. The solution creates a new array `ans` with a length of `2 * n` to store the concatenated result. The space used by the other variables (like `n` and `i`) is constant and doesn't depend on the size of the input.  Thus, the space complexity is dominated by the size of the `ans` array, making it linear with respect to the length of the input.
