## Contains Duplicate - LeetCode Problem Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem "Contains Duplicate" asks us to determine whether an array of integers contains any duplicate values. If any value appears at least twice in the array, the function should return `true`. Otherwise, if all elements are distinct, it should return `false`.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is to use a hash set (specifically `HashSet` in Java) to efficiently track the numbers we've encountered so far while iterating through the input array.  A hash set provides near-constant time complexity (O(1) on average) for insertion and membership testing (checking if an element already exists).

Here's the intuition:

1.  We iterate through the array element by element.
2.  For each element, we try to add it to the hash set.
3.  If the addition is successful (meaning the element wasn't already in the set), we continue.
4.  If the addition fails (meaning the element *was* already in the set), we've found a duplicate, and we immediately return `true`.
5.  If we reach the end of the array without finding any duplicates, we return `false`.

This approach is efficient because it avoids nested loops or sorting, which would lead to higher time complexities.  The `HashSet` efficiently manages the tracking of encountered numbers.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structure:** `HashSet` (or Hash Set): This is the primary data structure used. Hash sets are used to store unique elements and provide fast lookups (checking if an element is present).
*   **Algorithm:** Iteration and Hash Table Lookup: The algorithm iterates through the input array, and for each element, it performs a lookup in the hash set to determine if the element already exists.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean containsDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        HashSet<Integer> val = new HashSet<>(); // Initialize a HashSet to store integers.
        for(int v : nums) // Iterate through each integer 'v' in the input array 'nums'.
            if(!val.add(v)) // Attempt to add 'v' to the HashSet.  'add()' returns false if 'v' is already present.
                return true; // If 'add()' returns false, a duplicate has been found, so return true.
        return false; // If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, return false.
    }
}
```

**Line-by-line explanation:**

1.  `class Solution { ... }`: Defines the class containing the solution.
2.  `public boolean containsDuplicate(int[] nums) { ... }`: Declares the method that takes an integer array `nums` as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the array contains duplicates.
3.  `HashSet<Integer> val = new HashSet<>();`: Creates a new `HashSet` named `val` to store the integers encountered so far.  The `<Integer>` specifies that the set will store `Integer` objects.
4.  `for(int v : nums) { ... }`: This is an enhanced for loop (also known as a "for-each" loop) that iterates through each element in the `nums` array.  In each iteration, the current element is assigned to the variable `v`.
5.  `if(!val.add(v)) { ... }`: This is the core logic.  The `val.add(v)` method attempts to add the current element `v` to the `HashSet`.
    *   `val.add(v)` returns `true` if `v` was successfully added to the set (meaning it wasn't already present).
    *   `val.add(v)` returns `false` if `v` was already present in the set (meaning we've found a duplicate).
    *   The `!` operator negates the return value of `val.add(v)`.  So, `!val.add(v)` will be `true` if `val.add(v)` returned `false` (i.e., if a duplicate was found).
6.  `return true;`: If the `if` condition is true (a duplicate was found), the method immediately returns `true`.
7.  `return false;`: If the loop completes without finding any duplicates (i.e., the `if` condition was never true), the method returns `false`.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array `nums`.  This is because we iterate through the array once.  The `HashSet.add()` operation has an average time complexity of O(1). In the worst-case scenario (e.g., many hash collisions), `add()` could take O(n) time, but on average, it's considered O(1).
*   **Space Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array `nums`. In the worst case, if all elements in `nums` are unique, the `HashSet` will store all n elements. Therefore, the space required by the `HashSet` grows linearly with the size of the input.
