## LeetCode: Maximum Difference Between Increasing Elements - Solution Explained

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the maximum difference between two elements in an array, where the larger element appears *after* the smaller element in the array.  In other words, we need to find the largest possible profit if we were to buy and sell a stock, ensuring we buy before we sell.  If no such pair exists (meaning the array is non-increasing), the answer is -1.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution employs a single-pass approach using a variable to track the minimum element encountered so far. This approach is efficient because it avoids nested loops, which would result in a time complexity of O(n^2).

The core logic is as follows:

* We initialize `min` to the largest possible integer value (`Integer.MAX_VALUE`) to ensure that the first element of the array becomes the initial minimum.
* We initialize `ans` to -1 to represent the case where no increasing pair exists.
* We iterate through the array.  For each element:
    * If the current element is less than or equal to the current minimum, we update `min` to the current element. This is because a smaller element could potentially lead to a larger difference later.
    * If the current element is greater than the current minimum, it means we've found a potential pair. We calculate the difference (`nums[i] - min`) and update `ans` to the maximum of the current `ans` and this difference.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structure:** The primary data structure used is an array (`int[] nums`) to store the input numbers.  No other significant data structures are employed.
* **Algorithm:** The algorithm is a simple linear scan or single-pass algorithm.  It efficiently finds the maximum difference in a single iteration.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumDifference(int[] nums) {
        int ans = -1; // Initialize the maximum difference to -1 (no difference found yet)
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE; // Initialize the minimum element to the maximum possible integer value

        for(int i = 0 ; i<nums.length ; i++) { // Iterate through the array
            if(nums[i]<=min) min = nums[i]; // If current element is smaller than or equal to the current minimum, update the minimum
            else ans = Math.max(ans , nums[i]-min); // Otherwise, calculate the difference and update the maximum difference if necessary
        }
        return ans; // Return the maximum difference
    }
}
```

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input array.  The code iterates through the array only once.
* **Space Complexity:** O(1). The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space to store variables `ans` and `min`, regardless of the input array size.  The space used is independent of the input size 'n'.


This solution is highly efficient for solving the "Maximum Difference Between Increasing Elements" problem on LeetCode due to its linear time complexity and constant space usage.  It directly addresses the problem's constraints without unnecessary overhead.
