## LeetCode: Remove Element - Detailed Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The "Remove Element" problem asks us to remove all occurrences of a specific value (`val`) from an integer array (`nums`) *in-place*.  This means we should modify the original array directly, without creating a completely new array. The function should return the new length of the array *after* removing the specified value.  The order of the remaining elements doesn't need to be preserved.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The provided Java code uses a two-pass approach.  It first iterates through the input array, creating a new `ArrayList` containing only the elements that are *not* equal to the target value (`val`). Then, it iterates through the original array again, copying the elements from the `ArrayList` back into the original array.  Finally, any remaining spaces in the original array are filled with 0s, and the size of the `ArrayList` (which represents the new length) is returned.

While functional, this approach is not the most efficient.  A more optimal solution would involve a single-pass in-place algorithm,  avoiding the overhead of creating and copying from an `ArrayList`.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:** The primary data structures used are:
    * `int[] nums`: The input array of integers.
    * `ArrayList<Integer> ans`: An `ArrayList` used to temporarily store elements that are not equal to the target value.  This is inefficient for this problem.

* **Algorithms:** The algorithm used is a simple linear search.  The code iterates through the array once to filter elements and then again to populate the original array.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

```java
class Solution {
    public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
        ArrayList<Integer> ans = new ArrayList(); //Creates an ArrayList to store elements different from 'val'.
        for(int i = 0 ; i<nums.length ; i++) //First pass: Filters elements.
        {
            if(nums[i]!=val) ans.add(nums[i]); //Adds elements to 'ans' if not equal to 'val'.
        }
        for(int i = 0 ; i<nums.length ; i++) //Second pass: Copies elements back to 'nums'.
        {
            if(i<ans.size()) //Checks if there is an element to copy.
                nums[i] = ans.get(i); //Copies from 'ans' to 'nums'.
            else
                nums[i] = 0; //fills remaining elements with 0s.
        }
        return ans.size(); //Returns the size of 'ans', which is the new length.
    }
}
```

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the length of the input array. This is because the code iterates through the array twice.

* **Space Complexity:** O(N) in the worst case. This is because the `ArrayList ans` can potentially store all elements of the input array if `val` is not present in the array.  A more efficient in-place solution would have O(1) space complexity.

**Improved Solution (In-place, single pass):**

A significantly better solution would use two pointers: one to iterate through the array, and another to track the index where the next non-target element should be placed.

```java
class Solution {
    public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
        int k = 0; // Pointer for the next position of a non-target element.
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] != val) {
                nums[k++] = nums[i]; //Place the non-target element at position k and increment k
            }
        }
        return k; // k represents the new length of the array.
    }
}
```

This improved solution has O(N) time complexity but only O(1) space complexity, making it much more efficient.  It achieves the in-place modification requirement effectively.
