## Longest Common Prefix Problem Explanation

This document provides a detailed explanation of the Java code that solves the LeetCode problem "Longest Common Prefix".

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings. If there is no common prefix, we should return an empty string "".

For example:

*   Input: `strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]`
*   Output: `"fl"`

*   Input: `strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]`
*   Output: `""`

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The approach taken by the provided code is an iterative, horizontal scanning method.  Here's the breakdown:

1.  **Initialization:** We assume the first string in the array `strs[0]` is the initial longest common prefix (`ans`).
2.  **Iteration:** We iterate through the remaining strings in the array (`strs[1]` to `strs[n-1]`).
3.  **Comparison:** In each iteration, we compare the current `ans` with the current string `strs[i]` character by character.
4.  **Prefix Update:**  As soon as we find a mismatch or reach the end of either `ans` or `strs[i]`, we update `ans` to be the common prefix found so far. This is done by taking the substring of `strs[i]` from the beginning up to the index where the mismatch occurred.
5.  **Return:** After iterating through all the strings, the final `ans` will hold the longest common prefix of all the strings in the input array.

**Why this approach?**

This approach is relatively straightforward and easy to implement.  It avoids the need for more complex data structures or algorithms. The core idea is to progressively reduce the length of the `ans` string as we encounter more strings that might have shorter common prefixes. It directly compares the prefix with subsequent strings until the longest common prefix is identified.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   String array (`String[] strs`): The input array of strings.
    *   String (`ans`):  Stores the current longest common prefix.
*   **Algorithms:**
    *   Iteration (For loops):  Iterating through the array of strings and the characters of the strings.
    *   String comparison: Comparing characters of strings at corresponding indices.
    *   String substring: Extracting a substring to update the longest common prefix.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public String longestCommonPrefix(String[] strs) {
        String ans = strs[0]; // Initialize 'ans' with the first string
        for(int i = 1 ; i<strs.length ; i++) // Iterate through the remaining strings
        {
            int j = 0; // Initialize 'j' to 0 for character-by-character comparison
            for( ; j<strs[i].length() && j<ans.length() ; j++) // Iterate while 'j' is within the bounds of both strings
              if(ans.charAt(j)!=strs[i].charAt(j)) break; // If characters don't match, break the inner loop
            ans = strs[i].substring(0 , j); // Update 'ans' to the common prefix found so far
        }
        return ans; // Return the final longest common prefix
    }
}
```

*   **`String ans = strs[0];`**:  This line initializes the `ans` string with the first string in the input array. We assume this is the longest common prefix initially.
*   **`for(int i = 1 ; i<strs.length ; i++)`**:  This outer loop iterates through the remaining strings in the array, starting from the second string (index 1).
*   **`int j = 0;`**: Inside the outer loop, this line initializes `j` to 0. `j` acts as an index for character-by-character comparison between the current `ans` and the current string `strs[i]`.
*   **`for( ; j<strs[i].length() && j<ans.length() ; j++)`**: This inner loop compares the characters of `ans` and `strs[i]` at index `j`. The loop continues as long as `j` is within the bounds of both strings' lengths.
*   **`if(ans.charAt(j)!=strs[i].charAt(j)) break;`**: This line checks if the characters at index `j` in `ans` and `strs[i]` are different. If they are, it means the common prefix ends at index `j-1`. The `break` statement exits the inner loop.
*   **`ans = strs[i].substring(0 , j);`**: This line updates the `ans` string. `strs[i].substring(0, j)` creates a new string that is a substring of `strs[i]` from index 0 up to (but not including) index `j`. This substring represents the common prefix between `ans` and `strs[i]`.  Crucially, if `j` is 0 (meaning no characters matched), then `ans` becomes an empty string.
*   **`return ans;`**: After the outer loop completes, the `ans` string holds the longest common prefix among all the strings in the input array. The function returns this `ans` string.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(S), where S is the sum of all characters in all strings.  In the worst case, we might have to compare each character of each string with the current `ans`. The outer loop iterates `n-1` times (where n is the number of strings), and the inner loop iterates at most the length of the shortest string. In the best case when the first string has a much smaller length than the remaining strings or if there is no common prefix then the complexity would be linear i.e O(N) where N is the length of the smallest string.

*   **Space Complexity:** O(1). The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space. We are only storing the `ans` string, which holds the longest common prefix. The length of `ans` is bounded by the length of the shortest string in the input array, but it doesn't scale with the size of the input in a way that affects the overall space complexity analysis.
