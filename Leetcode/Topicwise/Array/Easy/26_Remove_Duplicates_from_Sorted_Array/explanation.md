### 1. Intuition

Imagine you have a sorted deck of cards, and you want to remove all the duplicate cards, keeping only one instance of each unique card.  You'd go through the deck, comparing each card to the previous one. If it's different, you keep it; otherwise, you discard it.  This solution uses a similar approach, using two pointers to efficiently manage this process within the array.


### 2. Approach

The code employs a two-pointer technique to remove duplicates in place (meaning it modifies the original array directly, rather than creating a new one).

1. **Initialization:** `i` is initialized to 0.  This pointer represents the index of the last unique element encountered so far.  `j` is initialized to 1 and acts as the iterator, traversing the array.

2. **Iteration:** The `for` loop iterates from the second element (`j=1`) to the end of the array.

3. **Comparison:** Inside the loop, `nums[i]` (the last unique element) is compared to `nums[j]` (the current element).

4. **Unique Element Found:** If `nums[i]` is different from `nums[j]`, it means we've encountered a new unique element.  We increment `i` (to point to the next position for a unique element) and then copy the value of `nums[j]` into `nums[i]`. This effectively shifts the unique element to its correct position.

5. **Duplicate Element Found:** If `nums[i]` is equal to `nums[j]`, it's a duplicate, so we do nothing; `j` continues to iterate.

6. **Result:** After the loop finishes, `i + 1` represents the number of unique elements in the array.  The unique elements are placed at the beginning of the array, followed by irrelevant elements (which don't affect the count of unique elements).  The function returns `i + 1`.

**Example:**

Let's say `nums = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]`.

- Initially, `i = 0`, `j = 1`.  `nums[i] = 1`, `nums[j] = 1` (duplicate).
- `j` becomes 2. `nums[i] = 1`, `nums[j] = 2` (unique). `i` becomes 1, `nums[1] = 2`.
- `j` becomes 3. `nums[i] = 2`, `nums[j] = 2` (duplicate).
- `j` becomes 4. `nums[i] = 2`, `nums[j] = 3` (unique). `i` becomes 2, `nums[2] = 3`.
- ...and so on.

Finally, the array will be modified to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 4, 5]` and the function will return 5 (the number of unique elements).


### 3. Data Structures

The primary data structure used is an **array** (`nums`).  The solution leverages the in-place nature of arrays to directly modify the array and avoid the overhead of creating a new one.


### 4. Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because the code iterates through the array once using the `for` loop.

- **Space Complexity:** O(1). The algorithm operates in-place, using a constant amount of extra space (for the variables `i` and `j`).  The space used doesn't scale with the input size.
