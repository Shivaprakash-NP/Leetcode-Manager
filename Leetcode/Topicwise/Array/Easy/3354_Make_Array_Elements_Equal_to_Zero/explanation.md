### Problem Understanding

The provided Java code defines a function `countValidSelections` that takes an integer array `nums` as input. Based on the logic within the function, it appears to solve a problem where we need to count specific "valid selections" or "pivot points" within the array.

Specifically, the function iterates through the array and focuses on indices `i` where the element `nums[i]` is zero. For each such index `i`, it calculates:
1.  The sum of elements to its left (`nums[0]` to `nums[i-1]`).
2.  The sum of elements to its right (`nums[i+1]` to `nums[n-1]`).

It then checks two conditions:
*   If the left sum is exactly equal to the right sum.
*   If the absolute difference between the left sum and the right sum is exactly 1.

The function accumulates a count (`ans`) based on these conditions, adding 2 for equality and 1 for a difference of 1.

**Note:** The problem title "Make Array Elements Equal to Zero" provided for this code seems to be a general title for a LeetCode problem, but the `countValidSelections` function itself appears to be a helper function or a solution to a sub-problem that involves finding specific split points based on sums, particularly when the split element is zero. I will explain the code based on its inherent logic, assuming it's designed to count these specific split conditions.

### Approach / Intuition

The core idea behind this solution is to efficiently calculate and compare prefix and suffix sums without repeatedly iterating over sub-arrays.

1.  **Pre-calculate Total Sum:** First, the total sum of all elements in the array is computed. This is a common optimization technique.
2.  **Iterate and Maintain Prefix Sum:** The solution then iterates through the array from left to right. A variable `cur` is used to maintain the sum of elements encountered *before* the current index `i`. This `cur` variable effectively represents the "left sum" for a potential split point at `i`.
3.  **Handle Zero Elements:** The problem's specific conditions are only applied when `nums[i]` is 0.
    *   When `nums[i]` is 0, `cur` already holds the sum of `nums[0]` to `nums[i-1]`.
    *   The sum of elements from `nums[i+1]` to `nums[n-1]` (the "right sum") can be efficiently calculated using the pre-computed total sum: `total_sum - cur - nums[i]`. Since `nums[i]` is 0, this simplifies to `total_sum - cur`. Let's call this `rem`.
    *   Now, we have `cur` (left sum) and `rem` (right sum) and can apply the problem's conditions (`rem == cur` or `abs(rem - cur) == 1`).
4.  **Update Prefix Sum:** If `nums[i]` is not 0, it simply means this element is part of the "left sum" for subsequent iterations, so it's added to `cur`.

This approach avoids nested loops, leading to a much more efficient solution than a naive O(N^2) approach that would re-calculate sums for each potential split point.

### Data Structures and Algorithms

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `int[] nums`: The input array.
*   **Algorithms:**
    *   **Prefix Sum:** The `cur` variable implicitly maintains a running prefix sum.
    *   **Single Pass Iteration:** The solution processes the array with two distinct single passes (one for total sum, one for checking conditions), making it highly efficient.

### Code Walkthrough

```java
class Solution {
    public int countValidSelections(int[] nums) {
        // 1. Calculate the total sum of all elements in the array.
        // This allows for efficient calculation of suffix sums later.
        int sum = 0;
        for(int v : nums) sum+=v; // First pass: O(N) to sum all elements

        int n = nums.length; // Store array length for loop bounds

        // 'cur' will store the sum of elements from nums[0] to nums[i-1].
        // It represents the "left sum" relative to the current index 'i'.
        int cur = 0;

        // 'ans' will store the final count of valid selections.
        int ans = 0;

        // 2. Iterate through the array to find valid selection points.
        for(int i = 0; i<n; i++) { // Second pass: O(N)
            // Check if the current element is 0.
            // The problem conditions are only applied when nums[i] is 0.
            if(nums[i] == 0) {
                // 'cur' is the sum of elements to the left of 'i' (nums[0]...nums[i-1]).

                // 'sum' is the total sum of all elements (nums[0]...nums[n-1]).
                // 'sum - cur' gives the sum of elements from nums[i] to nums[n-1].
                // Since nums[i] is 0 in this block, 'sum - cur' effectively gives
                // the sum of elements to the right of 'i' (nums[i+1]...nums[n-1]).
                int rem = sum-cur; // This is the "right sum"

                // Apply the problem's conditions:
                // If left sum (cur) equals right sum (rem), add 2 to answer.
                if(rem == cur) ans += 2;
                // Else if the absolute difference between left sum and right sum is 1, add 1 to answer.
                else if(Math.abs(rem-cur) == 1) ans++;
            } else {
                // If nums[i] is not 0, it contributes to the 'left sum' for the *next* iteration.
                // Update 'cur' by adding the current element.
                cur += nums[i];
            }
        }

        // Return the total count of valid selections.
        return ans;
    }
}
```

### Time and Space Complexity

*   **Time Complexity: O(N)**
    *   The first loop to calculate the `sum` of all elements iterates through the array once, taking O(N) time, where N is the number of elements in `nums`.
    *   The second loop, which iterates from `i = 0` to `n-1`, also processes each element once, taking O(N) time.
    *   Inside the loops, all operations (addition,
