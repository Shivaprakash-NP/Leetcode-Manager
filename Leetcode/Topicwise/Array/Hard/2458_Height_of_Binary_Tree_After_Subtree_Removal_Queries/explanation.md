## LeetCode: Height of Binary Tree After Subtree Removal Queries - Solution Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the height of a binary tree after removing a subtree rooted at a specific node.  We are given a binary tree and an array of queries, where each query represents a node's value to be removed. For each query, we need to determine the height of the remaining tree.  The height is the maximum depth from the root.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

This solution uses a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach to efficiently pre-compute the height of subtrees at each depth level in the original tree.  Instead of repeatedly traversing the tree for each query, it leverages this pre-computed information.

The core logic involves:

1.  **DFS Traversal:** A DFS function (`dfs`) calculates the height of each subtree and stores it in three maps:
    *   `dep`: Stores the two largest heights encountered at each depth level.  This is crucial for efficient height calculation after subtree removal.
    *   `val2dep`: Maps node values to their depth in the tree.
    *   `subhei`: Stores the height of the subtree rooted at each node.

2.  **Query Processing:** The `treeQueries` function iterates through the queries.  For each query node, it uses `val2dep` to find its depth and `dep` to find the two largest heights at that depth.  It then determines the height of the remaining tree after removing the subtree (by intelligently using the pre-computed values in `dep` and `subhei`), storing the result in the `ans` array.

This approach is chosen because it optimizes the runtime complexity.  Instead of repeatedly traversing the tree for each query (which would lead to O(N*Q) complexity, where N is the number of nodes and Q is the number of queries), it performs a single DFS traversal (O(N)) and then processes the queries in O(Q) time.

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `HashMap` (`dep`, `val2dep`, `subhei`): Used for efficient lookups of height information, depth, and subtree heights.
    *   `int[]`: Used within `dep` to store the two largest heights at each depth.
*   **Algorithms:**
    *   Depth-First Search (DFS):  Used to traverse the binary tree and pre-compute the necessary information.

**4. Code Walkthrough:**

*   **`TreeNode` Class:** A standard definition for a node in a binary tree.

*   **`dfs(TreeNode node, int d)`:**
    *   Base Case: If the node is `null`, it returns 0 (height of an empty subtree).
    *   Recursive Calls: Recursively calls itself for the left and right subtrees, incrementing the depth (`d`).
    *   Height Calculation: Calculates the height (`h`) of the current subtree as the maximum of the left and right subtree heights plus 1.
    *   `val2dep` Update: Stores the depth (`d`) of the current node in `val2dep`.
    *   `dep` Update: Updates `dep` to store the two largest heights encountered at the current depth (`d`).
    *   `subhei` Update: Stores the height (`h`) of the current subtree in `subhei`.
    *   Return Value: Returns the height (`h`) of the current subtree.

*   **`treeQueries(TreeNode root, int[] queries)`:**
    *   DFS Call: Calls `dfs` to pre-compute the height information.
    *   Iteration: Iterates through each query in `queries`.
    *   Depth Lookup: Gets the depth (`d`) of the query node using `val2dep`.
    *   Height Lookup: Gets the two largest heights (`h`) at depth `d` from `dep`.
    *   Height Calculation: Determines the height of the remaining tree after removing the subtree. If the removed subtree had the largest height, the new height will be the second largest height + depth; otherwise, it will be the largest height + depth.
    *   Result Storage: Stores the calculated height in the `ans` array.
    *   Return Value: Returns the `ans` array containing the heights after subtree removal for each query.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

*   **Time Complexity:** O(N + Q), where N is the number of nodes in the tree and Q is the number of queries. The DFS traversal takes O(N) time, and processing the queries takes O(Q) time.

*   **Space Complexity:** O(N), dominated by the space used by the `dep`, `val2dep`, and `subhei` HashMaps. In the worst case, each HashMap could store N entries (although `dep` will be limited by the maximum depth of the tree, usually much smaller than N).  The recursive call stack during DFS also contributes to the space complexity, which is proportional to the tree's height (in the worst case O(N) for a skewed tree).

The solution effectively trades space for time, resulting in a more efficient solution compared to repeatedly traversing the tree for each query.
