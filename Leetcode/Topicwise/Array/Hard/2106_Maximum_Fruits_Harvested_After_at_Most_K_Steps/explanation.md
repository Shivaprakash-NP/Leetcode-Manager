## Maximum Fruits Harvested After at Most K Steps: A Detailed Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the maximum number of fruits we can collect starting from a given position (`startPos`) and taking at most `k` steps.  We are given an array of fruit trees, where each tree is represented by its position and the number of fruits it contains.  We can move either left or right from our starting position.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution employs a two-pointer, sliding window technique with a crucial optimization. The core idea is to explore all possible combinations of steps to the left and right from the starting position, summing the fruits collected along the way.  However, a brute-force approach would be inefficient.

The optimization comes from using prefix sums (`pre`) to efficiently calculate the total fruits within a given range. Instead of iterating through each fruit tree within a range, we can find the sum in O(1) time using the prefix sum array.  The code then systematically explores all possible combinations of left and right movements, constrained by the total steps (`k`), to find the maximum fruit harvest. The code separates the exploration into two loops: one prioritizing movements to the left and the other prioritizing movements to the right.  This ensures all valid combinations are explored.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * `int[][] fruits`: A 2D array to store the position and quantity of fruits for each tree.
    * `int[] arr`: An array to store the number of fruits at each position. It's essentially a map from position to fruit count for efficient access.
    * `int[] pre`: A prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of fruits within a range.

* **Algorithms:**
    * **Prefix Sum:**  Used to calculate the cumulative sum of fruits, enabling O(1) range sum queries.
    * **Two-Pointer Sliding Window (with optimization):**  Iterates through possible left and right movements, efficiently calculating fruit totals using prefix sums.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **Initialization:**
    * `n = fruits.length`: Stores the number of fruit trees.
    * `maxPos = startPos + k`:  Initially sets the maximum position reachable. This is later updated to account for the farthest tree position.
    * `ans = Integer.MIN_VALUE`: Initializes the maximum fruits collected to the minimum possible value.
    * `arr`: Creates an array to map positions to fruit counts.  Initialized to 0.
    * `pre`: Creates the prefix sum array, also initialized to 0.

* **Fruit Data Processing:**
    * The loop `for(int[] fru : fruits) arr[fru[0]] = fru[1];` populates the `arr` array with the fruit counts at their respective positions.
    * The loop `pre[0] = arr[0]; for(int i = 1; i<=maxPos; i++) pre[i]=pre[i-1]+arr[i];` calculates the prefix sum of the `arr` array.  `pre[i]` will hold the sum of fruits from position 0 to i (inclusive).


* **Left-Right Movement Exploration:**
    * The loop `for(int l = 0; l<=k; l++)` iterates through all possible leftward movements (`l`).
    * `r = k - l * 2`: Calculates the remaining steps for rightward movement. If `r` is negative, it means we've exceeded the `k` step limit, so it continues to the next iteration.
    * `ls`, `le`, `rs`, `re`: These variables define the start and end positions for the left and right ranges. `Math.max` and `Math.min` are used to handle boundary conditions (avoiding negative indices).
    * `lval` and `rval`: These calculate the total fruits collected in the left and right ranges using prefix sums.  The subtraction (`-(ls>0?pre[ls-1]:0)`) handles the case where `ls` is 0 to prevent an array index out of bounds.
    * `ans = Math.max(ans, rval + lval - arr[startPos]);` Updates the maximum fruit count. The subtraction of `arr[startPos]` is essential since the fruits at the start position would be counted twice otherwise (once in left and once in right).

* **Right-Left Movement Exploration:**
    * This loop is similar to the previous one, but it prioritizes rightward movements first, thus ensuring all combinations are explored.

* **Return Value:**
    * `return ans`: Returns the maximum number of fruits collected.

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(k), where k is the maximum number of steps. The dominant operations are the two loops iterating up to `k` steps in total.  The prefix sum calculation is O(maxPos), but `maxPos` is at most linearly related to `k` and the number of trees.
* **Space Complexity:** O(maxPos), primarily due to the `arr` and `pre` arrays.  `maxPos` is again at most linearly related to `k` and the number of trees.


In summary, this solution efficiently solves the "Maximum Fruits Harvested After at Most K Steps" problem by leveraging prefix sums to optimize the calculation of fruit totals within ranges, allowing it to explore all valid combinations of left and right movements within the given step constraint in a time-efficient manner.
