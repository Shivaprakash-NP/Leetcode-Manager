## LeetCode Problem: Find the Minimum Area to Cover All Ones II (Detailed Explanation)

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks to find the minimum total area of three rectangular submatrices that together cover all the cells containing the value '1' in a given binary matrix.  The submatrices can overlap, but they must collectively encompass all '1's. We need to consider all possible divisions of the matrix and rotations to find the optimal solution.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution uses a brute-force approach combined with clever optimizations.  It explores all possible ways to divide the matrix into three horizontal or vertical submatrices. For each division, it calculates the minimum rectangular area containing all '1's within each submatrix. The algorithm then iterates through all possible divisions and rotations (0, 90, 180, 270 degrees) of the input matrix, keeping track of the minimum total area found.

This approach is chosen because, although brute-force, it systematically explores all possibilities. More sophisticated dynamic programming approaches would likely be more complex to implement and may not significantly improve performance given the relatively small input size (implicitly assumed).

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * 2D integer arrays (`int[][]`) are used to represent the input matrix and its submatrices.
* **Algorithms:**
    * **Brute-force search:** The algorithm iterates through all possible horizontal and vertical divisions of the matrix.
    * **Matrix rotation:** A helper function efficiently rotates the matrix by 90 degrees.
    * **Submatrix extraction:**  A helper function extracts a submatrix from a larger matrix.
    * **Minimum bounding rectangle:** A helper function efficiently finds the minimum rectangle containing all '1's in a given submatrix.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **`rotate(int[][] arr)`:** This function rotates a given matrix 90 degrees clockwise.  It creates a new matrix of the rotated dimensions and copies elements accordingly.

* **`createSubmatrix(int[][] original, int r1, int c1, int r2, int c2)`:** This function extracts a submatrix from the original matrix, given the starting and ending row and column indices.

* **`min(int[][] a)`:** This function calculates the minimum rectangular area encompassing all '1's within a given submatrix. It finds the topmost, bottommost, leftmost, and rightmost '1's to determine the bounding rectangle. If no '1's are present, it returns 0.

* **`minimumSum(int[][] a)`:** This is the main function.
    * It initializes `ans` to the maximum integer value.
    * It iterates four times (for four rotations).
    * **Horizontal Divisions:**  The nested loops iterate through all possible horizontal splits of the matrix into three submatrices.  It computes the minimum area for each submatrix using `min()` and updates `ans` if a smaller total area is found.
    * **Vertical Divisions (after horizontal):** Similar to the horizontal division, the code iterates through vertical divisions after each horizontal split attempt. A similar process is used here to calculate the minimum area for each submatrix.
    * **Matrix Rotation:** After processing all divisions for a given rotation, the matrix `a` is rotated using `rotate(a)`.
    * **Return Value:** Finally, the function returns the minimum total area `ans` found across all rotations.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(n³m + n⁴), where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns in the input matrix.  The dominant factor comes from the nested loops iterating through possible divisions (O(n³)) and the rotation process (O(nm)).
* **Space Complexity:** O(nm). The space used is primarily for creating new matrices during rotation and submatrix extraction.  The size of these matrices is proportional to the input matrix size.


**Potential Improvements:**

The algorithm's time complexity could be improved using a more sophisticated approach, such as dynamic programming or a more efficient search strategy. However, for moderately sized matrices, the brute force approach might be sufficient.  Additionally, handling edge cases (empty matrix or matrix with no '1's) more explicitly would enhance robustness.
