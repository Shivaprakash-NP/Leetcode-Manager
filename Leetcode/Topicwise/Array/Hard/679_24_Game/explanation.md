## LeetCode 24 Game: Detailed Solution Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The "24 Game" problem asks whether it's possible to obtain the number 24 using four given numbers (represented as integers) and the four basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).  Each number must be used exactly once, and the order of operations matters.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution employs a recursive backtracking approach.  It explores all possible combinations of operations and orderings of the numbers to see if 24 can be achieved.  The strategy is as follows:

* **Base Case:** If only one number remains and it's approximately equal to 24 (accounting for floating-point precision), the function returns `true`.
* **Recursive Step:**  The algorithm iterates through pairs of numbers in the current list. For each pair, it performs all four arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, handling division by zero appropriately).  It then recursively calls itself with the updated list containing the result of the operation. The original numbers are added back for exploring different operation combinations.
* **Backtracking:**  The crucial backtracking step ensures that the list is restored to its original state before considering the next pair of numbers.  This allows for exploration of all possible operation sequences.

This approach was chosen because it systematically explores the entire search space of possible combinations, guaranteeing a solution if one exists.  Other approaches might be less efficient or might not guarantee finding a solution.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * `ArrayList<Double>`:  Used to store the numbers during the recursive process.  `Double` is used to handle potential floating-point results of arithmetic operations.
* **Algorithms:**
    * **Backtracking:** The core algorithm is backtracking, systematically exploring all possible combinations of operations and number pairings.
    * **Recursion:** The backtracking is implemented recursively to efficiently manage the exploration of different combinations.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **`ans` and `eps`:** `ans` is a boolean flag indicating whether a solution has been found. `eps` is a small value used to account for floating-point inaccuracies when comparing to 24.

* **`rec(List<Double> arr)`:** This is the recursive function that performs the backtracking search.

    * **Base Case:** If `arr` has only one element, it checks if this element is approximately equal to 24 using `eps` for tolerance.  If it is, `ans` is set to `true`, and the function returns.
    * **Recursive Step:** It iterates through all pairs of numbers (`v1`, `v2`) in `arr`. For each pair, it calculates all possible arithmetic combinations (`v1+v2`, `v1-v2`, `v2-v1`, `v1*v2`, `v2/v1`, `v1/v2`, handling division by zero).
    * **List Manipulation:** It removes `v1` and `v2` from `arr`, adds the result of the operation, recursively calls itself (`rec`), and then restores `arr` to its previous state.  This is crucial for backtracking.


* **`judgePoint24(int[] cards)`:** This is the main function.
    * It converts the input integer array `cards` to a list of doubles `arr`.
    * It calls the recursive function `rec(arr)`.
    * It returns the value of `ans`.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is difficult to express precisely, but it's essentially O(N!), where N is the number of cards (4 in this case).  This is because the algorithm explores all possible permutations and combinations of operations.  The number of operations per recursive call is constant, so the factorial dominates.  In practical terms, for N=4, the execution is reasonably fast.

* **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(N) due to the recursive call stack.  The depth of the recursion is proportional to N, which is the number of cards. The ArrayList also has a space complexity of O(N), although the overall space complexity is still dominated by the recursive call stack.


In summary, this solution provides a clear, efficient, and understandable way to solve the 24 Game problem using backtracking and recursion. Although the time complexity is factorial in nature, for a fixed number of cards (4 in this problem) the runtime is acceptable. The code is well-structured and easy to follow, showcasing proper handling of edge cases like division by zero.
