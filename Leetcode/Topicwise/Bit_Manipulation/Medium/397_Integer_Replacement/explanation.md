## Integer Replacement Problem and Solution Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The "Integer Replacement" problem asks us to find the minimum number of steps to transform a given positive integer `n` to 1 using the following rules:

*   If `n` is even, replace `n` with `n / 2`.
*   If `n` is odd, you can replace `n` with either `n + 1` or `n - 1`.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is to prioritize division by 2 whenever possible.  When we encounter an odd number, the choice between adding 1 or subtracting 1 becomes crucial. A greedy approach is generally used.  Let's consider the consequences:

*   **If `n` is odd, and `n + 1` is divisible by 4, then `(n + 1) / 2` is even.**  Subtracting 1 and then dividing by 2 will often lead to more subsequent divisions by 2.
*   **If `n` is odd, and `n - 1` is divisible by 4, then `(n - 1) / 2` is even.** Similar logic as above.

So, when faced with an odd number, we generally want to choose the operation (adding or subtracting 1) that results in a number divisible by 4.  This sets us up for more divisions by 2 later.

However, a special case exists when `n` is 3. If we subtract 1, we get 2, and then divide by 2 to get 1, taking a total of 2 steps. If we add 1, we get 4, divide by 2 to get 2, and then divide by 2 to get 1, taking a total of 2 steps. So, if n is equal to 3, it will take 2 steps to reach 1.

The reason this problem uses a greedy approach is because it's difficult to explore all possible paths to 1 within the time limit due to the exponential branching (choosing between +1 and -1 for odd numbers). The greedy strategy often provides an efficient solution.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **No complex data structures are used.** We primarily work with integer variables.
*   **Greedy Algorithm:** The solution implements a greedy approach to decide whether to increment or decrement an odd number.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int integerReplacement(int n) {
        int ans = 0;  // Initialize the count of operations.
        long nn = n;  // Use long to avoid potential integer overflow when n is close to Integer.MAX_VALUE

        while(nn!=1) { // Loop until n becomes 1
            if(nn == 3) { // Special case: if n is 3, 2 steps are required.
                ans+=2;
                break;
            }

            if(nn%2 == 0) nn /= 2; // If n is even, divide it by 2.
            else if(((nn-1)/2)%2 == 0) nn--;  // If (n-1)/2 is even, decrement n
            else nn++; // Otherwise, increment n.

            ans++; // Increment the operation count in each step.
        }

        return ans; // Return the total operation count.
    }
}
```

*   **`int ans = 0;`**: Initializes a counter `ans` to keep track of the number of operations performed.

*   **`long nn = n;`**:  Creates a `long` variable `nn` to store the input integer `n`.  This is important because adding 1 to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` causes an overflow, leading to incorrect results.

*   **`while (nn != 1)`**: The main loop continues until `nn` becomes 1.

*    **`if(nn == 3) { ans+=2; break; }`**: This handles the special case where n is 3 and we know 2 steps are needed.

*   **`if (nn % 2 == 0)`**: If `nn` is even (divisible by 2), we divide it by 2 (`nn /= 2`). This is always the optimal move when `nn` is even.

*   **`else if (((nn - 1) / 2) % 2 == 0)`**: If `nn` is odd, this condition checks if `(nn - 1) / 2` is even.  If it is, it means `nn - 1` is divisible by 4 (i.e., `nn` is of the form `4k + 1`). In this case, we decrement `nn` ( `nn--`).

*   **`else nn++;`**: If the previous condition is false, it means `(nn + 1) / 2` is even, or `nn + 1` is divisible by 4 (i.e., `nn` is of the form `4k + 3`). In this case, we increment `nn` (`nn++`).

*   **`ans++;`**:  Increments the operation count `ans` after each step.

*   **`return ans;`**: Returns the final count of operations.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:**  O(log n) in most cases. Each division by 2 halves the value of `n`, so the loop iterates a number of times proportional to the number of times `n` can be divided by 2. In the worst case (where n is close to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` and requires many increment/decrement operations before significant divisions), the complexity remains logarithmic.

*   **Space Complexity:** O(1). The solution uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input value `n`.  Only a few integer variables are used.
