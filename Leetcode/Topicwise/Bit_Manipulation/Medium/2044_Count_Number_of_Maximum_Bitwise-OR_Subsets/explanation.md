## LeetCode: Count Number of Maximum Bitwise-OR Subsets - Solution Explained

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the number of subsets of a given integer array `nums` whose bitwise OR operation results in the maximum possible value achievable from any subset of `nums`.  In simpler terms, we need to count how many subsets produce the largest possible bitwise OR value.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution employs a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore all possible subsets of the input array.  The core idea is that for each element, we have two choices: either include it in the current subset or exclude it.  By recursively exploring these choices, we can generate all possible subsets.  We maintain a running bitwise OR (`orval`) for the current subset.  We keep track of the maximum OR value encountered so far (`max`).  Finally, we count the number of subsets (`ans`) that achieve this maximum `max` value.  This approach is chosen because it systematically explores the entire search space of subsets without needing to explicitly generate all subsets, which would be inefficient for larger input arrays.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**  The primary data structure used is the input array `nums` itself.  No other significant data structures are explicitly used; the recursive calls manage the exploration of the subset space implicitly.
* **Algorithms:** The core algorithm is depth-first search (DFS), a recursive backtracking algorithm.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **`max = 0; ans = 0;`**: These lines initialize two instance variables: `max` to store the maximum bitwise OR value found so far and `ans` to count the number of subsets achieving this maximum.

* **`private void dfs(int[] nums, int i, int orval)`**: This is the recursive DFS function.
    * **`if(i == nums.length)`**: This is the base case of the recursion.  When we reach the end of the array (`i` equals the length of `nums`), it means we've considered all elements. We check if the current `orval` is equal to the maximum `max`. If it is, we increment `ans`.
    * **`dfs(nums, i+1, orval | nums[i]);`**: This recursive call explores the possibility of including the current element `nums[i]` in the subset. We perform a bitwise OR (`|`) operation between the current `orval` and `nums[i]` to update `orval`.
    * **`dfs(nums, i+1, orval);`**: This recursive call explores the possibility of excluding the current element `nums[i]` from the subset.  `orval` remains unchanged.

* **`public int countMaxOrSubsets(int[] nums)`**: This is the main function.
    * **`for(int v : nums) max |= v;`**: This line efficiently calculates the maximum possible bitwise OR value that can be achieved by any subset.  It performs a bitwise OR of all elements in `nums`, resulting in the `max` value. This is an optimization because any subset's OR value cannot exceed this.
    * **`dfs(nums, 0, 0);`**: This line initiates the DFS traversal, starting from the first element (`i=0`) with an initial `orval` of 0.
    * **`return ans;`**: The function returns the final count `ans` of subsets that achieved the maximum bitwise OR.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(2<sup>n</sup>), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because the DFS explores all possible subsets, and the number of subsets is 2<sup>n</sup>.

* **Space Complexity:** O(n) in the worst case. This is due to the recursive call stack depth, which can be at most `n` in the worst case (when we explore the longest path in the recursion tree).  The space used by the input array is not considered in the space complexity analysis as it is input and thus already considered present.

The algorithm is exponential in time complexity.  While this is unavoidable for a brute force solution to this problem,  it's important to be aware of its limitations for very large input arrays.
