## Single Number Problem Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The "Single Number" problem on LeetCode asks us to find the one element in an array of integers that appears only once, while all other elements appear exactly twice.  For example, given the array `[2, 2, 1]`, the function should return `1`.  The constraints typically include that the array will always have exactly one element that appears only once.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The solution leverages the properties of the XOR (exclusive OR) operation.

*   **XOR Identity:**  `x ^ 0 = x` (XOR with 0 returns the original number).
*   **XOR Self-Inverse:** `x ^ x = 0` (XOR of a number with itself is 0).
*   **XOR Commutativity and Associativity:**  `x ^ y = y ^ x` and `(x ^ y) ^ z = x ^ (y ^ z)`

The core idea is to XOR all the numbers in the array together. Due to the properties above, when a number appears twice, its XOR cancels itself out (resulting in 0). The number that appears only once will remain after all the XOR operations.

**Why XOR?**  XOR provides an efficient and elegant way to identify the unique number without using extra space (like a hash map).

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structure:** None.  The solution operates directly on the input array.
*   **Algorithm:** XOR operation (bitwise exclusive OR).

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int flag = 0; // Initialize a variable 'flag' to 0. This will accumulate the XOR result.
        for(int num : nums) // Iterate through each number 'num' in the input array 'nums'.
        {
            flag ^= num; // Perform the XOR operation: flag = flag XOR num.
        }
        return flag; // After iterating through all numbers, 'flag' will contain the single number, so return it.
    }
}
```

**Line-by-line Explanation:**

1.  `class Solution { ... }`: Defines the Solution class, which is standard LeetCode format.
2.  `public int singleNumber(int[] nums) { ... }`: Defines the `singleNumber` method, which takes an integer array `nums` as input and returns an integer representing the single number.
3.  `int flag = 0;`: Initializes an integer variable `flag` to 0. This variable will store the cumulative XOR of all numbers in the array.  Starting with 0 is important because 0 is the identity element for the XOR operation (anything XORed with 0 remains unchanged).
4.  `for(int num : nums) { ... }`: This is an enhanced for-loop (also known as a "for-each" loop) that iterates through each element in the `nums` array.  In each iteration, the current element is assigned to the variable `num`.
5.  `flag ^= num;`: This is the core of the algorithm. It performs the XOR operation between the current value of `flag` and the current number `num` in the array, and then assigns the result back to `flag`.  This is equivalent to `flag = flag ^ num;`.
6.  `return flag;`: After the loop completes, the `flag` variable will hold the single number that appears only once in the array. The method returns this value.

**Example:**

Let's say `nums = [2, 2, 1]`.

*   `flag` starts at 0.
*   `flag ^= 2`: `flag` becomes `0 ^ 2 = 2`.
*   `flag ^= 2`: `flag` becomes `2 ^ 2 = 0`.
*   `flag ^= 1`: `flag` becomes `0 ^ 1 = 1`.
*   The function returns `1`.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity: O(n)** - The code iterates through the input array `nums` once. The XOR operation takes constant time.
*   **Space Complexity: O(1)** - The code uses a single integer variable `flag` to store the XOR result. It does not use any additional data structures that scale with the size of the input. This is constant space.
