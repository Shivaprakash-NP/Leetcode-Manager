## LeetCode: Find the K-th Character in String Game I - Detailed Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the k-th character in a string generated by a specific rule.  The string starts with "a".  In each iteration, a new string is generated by incrementing each character of the current string by 1 (wrapping around from 'z' to 'a'), and appending this new string to the original. We need to efficiently determine the k-th character in this ever-growing string without explicitly building the entire string.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution uses an iterative approach. We start with the string "a".  In each iteration, we generate the next string in the sequence by incrementing each character and appending it.  We continue this process until the length of the generated string is greater than or equal to `k`.  Finally, we return the `k-1`th character (because arrays/strings are 0-indexed).  This approach avoids unnecessary computations by only generating as much of the string as needed.

This approach was chosen because it directly addresses the problem statement's requirements. It's efficient because it only constructs the necessary part of the string, avoiding the potentially enormous cost of building the complete string for large values of `k`.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:** `StringBuilder` is used for efficient string manipulation.  Using `StringBuilder` is crucial for performance, especially for large `k` values, as string concatenation using the `+` operator creates many temporary string objects.
* **Algorithms:** The core algorithm is iterative string generation. The process uses a simple loop and character manipulation.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

```java
class Solution {
    public char kthCharacter(int k) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("a"); // Initialize with "a"

        while (sb.length() <= k) { // Continue until string length exceeds k
            StringBuilder sb1 = new StringBuilder(); // Temporary StringBuilder for the next iteration
            for (int i = 0; i < sb.length(); i++) { // Iterate through the current string
                char nc = (char) ((sb.charAt(i) - 'a' + 1) % 26 + 'a'); // Increment character, wrap around 'z'
                sb1.append(nc); // Append to the new string
            }
            sb.append(sb1); // Append the new string to the original
        }

        return sb.charAt(k-1); // Return the k-th character (0-indexed)
    }
}
```

- **`StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("a");`**: Initializes a `StringBuilder` named `sb` with the initial string "a".
- **`while (sb.length() <= k)`**: This loop continues until the length of `sb` becomes greater than `k`. This ensures that we generate enough of the string to find the k-th character.
- **`StringBuilder sb1 = new StringBuilder();`**: Creates a temporary `StringBuilder` to store the next iteration's string.
- **`for (int i = 0; i < sb.length(); i++)`**: This loop iterates through each character of the current string `sb`.
- **`char nc = (char) ((sb.charAt(i) - 'a' + 1) % 26 + 'a');`**: This line is the core of the character generation. It takes the current character, subtracts 'a' to get its index (0-25), adds 1 (to increment), takes the modulo 26 (to wrap around from 'z' to 'a'), and adds 'a' back to convert the index back to a character.
- **`sb1.append(nc);`**: Appends the newly generated character `nc` to `sb1`.
- **`sb.append(sb1);`**: Appends the completed `sb1` (the next iteration's string) to `sb`.
- **`return sb.charAt(k-1);`**: Returns the character at the `k-1`th index (0-indexed) of the final `sb`.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(k). The algorithm iteratively builds the string.  In the worst case, the length of the string will grow exponentially until it exceeds `k`. However, the number of iterations is bounded by the log(k) because the string length roughly doubles in each iteration.  The inner loop's work is proportional to the current string length, but the sum of string lengths across iterations is still roughly proportional to `k` giving a O(k) overall time complexity.

* **Space Complexity:** O(k). The maximum space used by the `StringBuilder` `sb` is proportional to `k`, as it holds at most a string of length slightly larger than `k`.  The temporary `StringBuilder` `sb1` also has a maximum length proportional to `k`, but it's reused in each iteration. Thus, the overall space complexity is O(k).
