## LeetCode: Counting Bits - Detailed Solution Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The "Counting Bits" problem asks us to create an array where each index `i` contains the count of 1s in the binary representation of `i`.  For example, if `n=5`, the output should be `[0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2]` because:

* 0 has 0 bits set (0b0)
* 1 has 1 bit set (0b1)
* 2 has 1 bit set (0b10)
* 3 has 2 bits set (0b11)
* 4 has 1 bit set (0b100)
* 5 has 2 bits set (0b101)


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution uses a dynamic programming approach with a clever bit manipulation trick.  Instead of calculating the number of set bits for each number from scratch, it leverages the fact that the number of set bits in a number `i` is related to the number of set bits in `i/2` (integer division).

Specifically:

* If `i` is even, the number of set bits in `i` is the same as the number of set bits in `i/2`.  This is because dividing an even number by 2 simply shifts its binary representation to the right by one bit, without changing the count of 1s.

* If `i` is odd, the number of set bits in `i` is one more than the number of set bits in `i/2`. This is because an odd number has a 1 in its least significant bit, in addition to the set bits already present in its higher-order bits (which are represented by `i/2`).

This relationship allows us to build the solution iteratively, starting from 0 and calculating the count for each subsequent number based on the previously computed counts. This is significantly more efficient than repeatedly counting set bits using methods like bit-counting loops or built-in functions.

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structure:** An integer array (`ans`) is used to store the count of set bits for each number from 0 to `n`.
* **Algorithm:** Dynamic Programming and Bit Manipulation.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] countBits(int n) {
        int[] ans = new int[n+1]; // Initialize an array to store the results. Size is n+1 to include 0 to n.
        ans[0] = 0; // Base case: 0 has 0 set bits.

        for(int i = 1 ; i<=n ; i++) { // Iterate from 1 to n (inclusive).
            ans[i] = ans[i >> 1] + (i & 1); // The core logic:
                                            // i >> 1 performs right bit shift (equivalent to integer division by 2).
                                            // i & 1 checks if i is odd (returns 1 if odd, 0 if even).
        }

        return ans; // Return the array containing the counts of set bits.
    }
}
```

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(n). The code iterates through the numbers from 1 to n once.  Each operation inside the loop (right bit shift and bitwise AND) takes constant time.

* **Space Complexity:** O(n). The solution uses an array `ans` of size `n+1` to store the results.  The space used is directly proportional to the input `n`.


**In summary:** This solution efficiently solves the Counting Bits problem using dynamic programming and bit manipulation techniques. The clever use of bitwise operations (`>>` and `&`) makes the code concise and avoids the need for computationally expensive methods like iterating through bits individually. The linear time and space complexity make it optimal for a wide range of input sizes.
