## Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero: Detailed Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to find the minimum number of steps required to reduce a given non-negative integer `num` to zero. We are allowed to perform two operations:

*   If `num` is even, divide it by 2.
*   If `num` is odd, subtract 1 from it.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is to directly simulate the operations described in the problem statement.  We repeatedly check if the number is even or odd and perform the corresponding operation, incrementing a counter for each step. The simulation continues until the number becomes zero.  This direct simulation is efficient because the number of steps is bounded by the value of `num` itself. No complex data structures or algorithms are required. The bitwise operations (`&` and `>>`) provide a more efficient way to check for even/odd and perform division by 2.

**Why this approach?**

*   **Simplicity:** This is the most straightforward way to translate the problem description into code.
*   **Efficiency:** Bitwise operations are generally very fast, making the simulation efficient.
*   **No need for complex data structures:** Avoids unnecessary overhead.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:** We only use an integer variable (`num`) to store the current number and another integer variable (`c`) to keep track of the number of steps. No complex data structures are needed.
*   **Algorithms:** The solution uses a simple `while` loop for iterative reduction, combined with conditional logic (`if-else`) to determine the operation to perform based on whether the number is even or odd. Bitwise operators (`&`, `>>`) are used for checking parity and division.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfSteps(int num) {
        int c = 0; // Initialize a counter to store the number of steps.
        while(num > 0) { // Loop until the number becomes zero.
            c++; // Increment the step counter for each operation.
            if((num&1) == 1) num-=1; // If the number is odd (least significant bit is 1), subtract 1.
            else num >>= 1; // If the number is even (least significant bit is 0), divide by 2 (right bit shift).
        }
        return c; // Return the total number of steps.
    }
}
```

*   **`int c = 0;`**:  Initializes an integer variable `c` to 0. This variable will store the number of steps taken.
*   **`while(num > 0)`**:  This loop continues as long as the current number `num` is greater than 0.
*   **`c++;`**:  Increments the step counter `c` by 1 in each iteration of the loop, representing one step taken.
*   **`if((num&1) == 1)`**: This condition checks if `num` is odd. The `&` operator performs a bitwise AND. `num & 1` effectively isolates the least significant bit of `num`. If the least significant bit is 1, the number is odd.
*   **`num-=1;`**: If the number is odd, we subtract 1 from it.
*   **`else num >>= 1;`**: If the number is even, we divide it by 2 using the right bit shift operator `>>=`.  `num >>= 1` is equivalent to `num = num / 2`.
*   **`return c;`**: After the `while` loop terminates (when `num` becomes 0), the function returns the final value of `c`, which represents the total number of steps taken.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(log N), where N is the initial value of `num`.  In the worst-case scenario (when `num` is a power of 2), the number of divisions by 2 needed to reach 0 is logarithmic with respect to `num`. In other cases, subtraction operations might also occur.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1). The solution uses only a constant amount of extra space for the integer variables `c` and `num`. No additional data structures are used that scale with the input size.
