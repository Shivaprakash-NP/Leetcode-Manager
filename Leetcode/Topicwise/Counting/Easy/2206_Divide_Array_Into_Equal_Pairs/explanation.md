## Divide Array Into Equal Pairs: Explanation

Here's a breakdown of the provided Java code for the LeetCode problem "Divide Array Into Equal Pairs":

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to determine if an array of integers can be divided into pairs such that each pair contains the same integer. In other words, we need to check if every number in the array appears an even number of times. If it is possible to create such pairs using every element of the input array, we return `true`. Otherwise, we return `false`.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea behind this solution is based on sorting the array.  If the array can be divided into equal pairs, then after sorting, elements that belong to a pair will necessarily be adjacent to each other. For example, if the array is `[3, 2, 3, 2]`, after sorting it becomes `[2, 2, 3, 3]`.  We can then iterate through the sorted array and check if `nums[i]` is equal to `nums[i+1]` for every even `i`. If we find even one pair where `nums[i]` and `nums[i+1]` are not equal, it means that the array cannot be divided into equal pairs, and we return `false`. If we iterate through the entire array without finding unequal adjacent pairs, we return `true`.

This approach is chosen because sorting allows for a simple, linear scan to verify the pairing condition. An alternative using a HashMap to count occurrences would also work, but the sorting-based approach can be quite efficient in practice and arguably more straightforward to implement in this specific scenario.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structure:** `int[] nums` (the input array of integers)
*   **Algorithm:**
    *   **Sorting:** `Arrays.sort(nums)` (Uses an efficient sorting algorithm like quicksort or mergesort provided by the Java library)
    *   **Linear Scan:** A `for` loop iterates through the sorted array, checking pairs of elements.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public boolean divideArray(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums); // Sort the input array in ascending order

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i += 2) { // Iterate through the array with a step of 2
            if (nums[i] != nums[i + 1]) { // Check if the current element is not equal to the next element
                return false; // If they are not equal, return false (cannot be divided into pairs)
            }
        }

        return true; // If the loop completes without finding any unequal pairs, return true
    }
}
```

1.  **`import java.util.*;`**: This line imports the `java.util` package, which contains utility classes like `Arrays` used for sorting.

2.  **`class Solution { ... }`**: This defines the `Solution` class where the `divideArray` method resides.

3.  **`public boolean divideArray(int[] nums) { ... }`**: This is the method that takes an integer array `nums` as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the array can be divided into equal pairs.

4.  **`Arrays.sort(nums);`**:  This line sorts the input array `nums` in ascending order.  This is a crucial step for grouping identical numbers together.  Java's `Arrays.sort()` uses an efficient sorting algorithm, typically a variant of quicksort.

5.  **`for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i += 2) { ... }`**: This loop iterates through the sorted array.  `i` starts at 0 and increments by 2 in each iteration. This is because we are comparing elements in pairs.

6.  **`if (nums[i] != nums[i + 1]) { return false; }`**: Inside the loop, this condition checks if the element at index `i` is not equal to the element at index `i + 1`. If they are not equal, it means that the array cannot be divided into equal pairs, so the method immediately returns `false`.

7.  **`return true;`**: If the loop completes without finding any unequal pairs (i.e., the `if` condition never evaluates to true), it means that the array can be divided into equal pairs, so the method returns `true`.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n log n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. The dominant operation is the `Arrays.sort(nums)` call, which typically has a time complexity of O(n log n) using efficient sorting algorithms. The subsequent `for` loop iterates through the array in O(n) time, but it is dominated by the sorting step.

*   **Space Complexity:** O(1) or O(log n). This depends on the sorting algorithm used by `Arrays.sort()`. In place sorting algorithms (e.g., heapsort) would use O(1) auxiliary space. Algorithms like mergesort may use O(log n) auxilliary space. From the perspective of the code itself it seems to use constant extra space. The sorting itself might require more auxiliary space depending on the underlying implementation.
