## Sum of Beauty of All Substrings - Detailed Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The "Sum of Beauty of All Substrings" problem asks us to calculate the sum of the "beauty" of all possible substrings within a given string `s`. The "beauty" of a substring is defined as the difference between the frequency of the most frequent character and the frequency of the least frequent character in that substring.

For example, if the substring is "aabcb", the most frequent character is 'a' (frequency 2), and the least frequent character is 'c' or 'b' (frequency 1). The beauty of this substring is 2 - 1 = 1.  We need to iterate through all possible substrings of `s`, compute the beauty of each, and return the sum of these beauties.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is to iterate through all possible substrings of the given string `s` and, for each substring, calculate its beauty value according to the problem definition.

*   **Iterating through Substrings:**  We use nested loops to generate all possible substrings. The outer loop (`i`) determines the starting index of the substring, and the inner loop (`j`) determines the ending index of the substring.

*   **Calculating Beauty:** For each substring, we need to find the maximum and minimum character frequencies.  A frequency array is used to store the counts of each character.

*   **Why this approach?** This approach is straightforward and easy to understand.  It directly implements the problem's definition.  While it might not be the most optimized solution, it's a good starting point to understand the problem and develop a working solution.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `int[] arr`: An integer array of size 26 is used to store the frequency of each lowercase English letter in the current substring. The index represents the character (a=0, b=1, ..., z=25), and the value at that index represents the count of that character in the substring.

*   **Algorithms:**
    *   **Nested Loops:** Used to generate all possible substrings.
    *   **Frequency Counting:**  Counting the occurrences of each character within a substring.
    *   **Finding Min/Max:** Iterating through the frequency array to determine the minimum and maximum frequencies.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int beautySum(String s) {
        int sum = 0; // Initialize the total sum of beauty values.
        for(int i = 0 ; i<s.length() ; i++) // Outer loop: iterates from the start of the string to create all possible starting positions of substrings
        {   
            int[] arr = new int[26]; // Frequency array to store character counts for the CURRENT substring.  Resets for each new starting position (i).
            for(int j = i ; j<s.length() ; j++) // Inner loop: iterates from the current starting position (i) to the end of the string, creating all possible substrings starting at 'i'.
            {
                int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE; // Initialize min frequency to the maximum possible integer value.
                int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE; // Initialize max frequency to the minimum possible integer value.
                arr[s.charAt(j)-97]++; // Increment the count of the character at index 'j' in the frequency array. 's.charAt(j)-97' calculates the index for lowercase letters (a=0, b=1, ..., z=25).

                for(int v : arr) // Iterate through the frequency array to find the minimum and maximum frequencies.
                {
                    if(v>0) // Only consider characters that exist in the substring (frequency > 0).
                    {
                        min = Math.min(min , v); // Update 'min' with the minimum frequency encountered so far.
                        max = Math.max(max , v); // Update 'max' with the maximum frequency encountered so far.
                    }
                }
                sum+=(max-min); // Calculate the beauty of the current substring (max frequency - min frequency) and add it to the total sum.
            }
        }
        return sum; // Return the total sum of beauty values for all substrings.
    }
}
```

**Detailed explanation by line:**

1.  `class Solution {`: Defines a class named `Solution` which contains the solution.
2.  `public int beautySum(String s) {`: Defines the `beautySum` method that takes a string `s` as input and returns an integer, which is the total beauty sum.
3.  `int sum = 0;`: Initializes an integer variable `sum` to 0. This variable will store the cumulative sum of the beauty of all substrings.
4.  `for(int i = 0 ; i<s.length() ; i++)`: The outer loop iterates through each character of the string `s`. The variable `i` represents the starting index of the substring.
5.  `int[] arr = new int[26];`: Inside the outer loop, a new integer array `arr` of size 26 is created. This array will store the frequency of each lowercase English alphabet character in the current substring. It is reset for each starting position `i`.
6.  `for(int j = i ; j<s.length() ; j++)`: The inner loop iterates from the current starting index `i` to the end of the string `s`. The variable `j` represents the ending index of the substring.
7.  `int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;`: Initializes an integer variable `min` to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. This variable will store the minimum frequency of a character in the current substring.
8.  `int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;`: Initializes an integer variable `max` to `Integer.MIN_VALUE`. This variable will store the maximum frequency of a character in the current substring.
9.  `arr[s.charAt(j)-97]++;`: This line updates the frequency count of the character at index `j`. `s.charAt(j)` gets the character at index `j`, and subtracting 97 (ASCII value of 'a') from it gives the index of the character in the frequency array `arr` (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', and so on).
10. `for(int v : arr)`: This enhanced for loop iterates through each element `v` in the frequency array `arr`.
11. `if(v>0)`: This condition checks if the frequency of a character is greater than 0, meaning that the character is present in the current substring.
12. `min = Math.min(min , v);`: If the character is present in the substring, update `min` with the minimum frequency encountered so far.
13. `max = Math.max(max , v);`:  If the character is present in the substring, update `max` with the maximum frequency encountered so far.
14. `sum+=(max-min);`: After iterating through the entire frequency array, calculate the beauty of the current substring (max frequency - min frequency) and add it to the total sum `sum`.
15. `return sum;`: After processing all substrings, return the total sum of beauty values.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n^3), where n is the length of the string `s`.
    *   The outer loop runs `n` times.
    *   The inner loop runs up to `n` times.
    *   The loop iterating through the frequency array (size 26) inside the inner loop effectively takes O(1) time because it has a fixed size. However, it contributes as a factor in the calculation of the overall time complexity within the inner loop.
    *   Therefore, the nested loops dominate, and the complexity is O(n * n * 26), which simplifies to O(n^2). The min/max finding operation takes O(1). Therefore, the time complexity is O(n^2). There's an iteration of length 26, but we consider this constant.
    * **Edit:** Corrected Time complexity, the innermost loop is a constant time loop O(26) and hence the complexity is O(n^2).

*   **Space Complexity:** O(1). The space used by the `arr` array is constant (26 integers), regardless of the input string size. Therefore, the space complexity is O(1).
