## Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II - Explained

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem "Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II" asks us to modify a sorted array in-place such that each unique element appears at most twice.  We need to return the new length of the modified array.  We cannot use extra space (O(1) space complexity).  For example, given `nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]`, the function should modify `nums` to be `[1,1,2,2,3,_]` and return 5. The values beyond the returned length are irrelevant.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is to use a two-pointer approach.  We maintain two pointers: `i` (the fast pointer) iterates through the entire input array, and `ind` (the slow pointer) points to the next available position in the modified array where a new element should be placed.  Since the array is sorted, we can easily check if the current element `nums[i]` should be added to the modified array. Specifically, we only add `nums[i]` if it's different from the element two positions behind the slow pointer (`nums[ind-2]`).  This ensures that no element appears more than twice.

Why this approach? Because it satisfies the O(1) space constraint.  We are directly modifying the given array in place and using only constant extra variables (the pointers).  The sorted nature of the array is crucial, allowing us to determine duplicates efficiently by checking against the element two positions back.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structure:** The primary data structure is the input array `nums`.
*   **Algorithm:**  Two-pointer technique and iterative processing. This uses an in-place array modification strategy which is essential due to the problem's space complexity restriction.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        if(nums.length <= 2) return nums.length;
        int ind = 2;
        for(int i = 2 ; i<nums.length ; i++)
            if(nums[i] != nums[ind-2])
                nums[ind++] = nums[i];
        return ind;
    }
}
```

1.  **`if(nums.length <= 2) return nums.length;`**: This is a base case. If the array has 2 or fewer elements, we simply return the length of the array, as each element can appear at most twice by default. No modification is necessary.

2.  **`int ind = 2;`**: `ind` is the slow pointer. It represents the index where the next non-duplicate element will be placed. We initialize it to 2 because the first two elements of the original array are guaranteed to be valid (i.e., allowed to be in the final result) since each element can occur at most twice. If the length is greater than 2, then these first two elements are definitely part of the modified array.

3.  **`for(int i = 2 ; i<nums.length ; i++)`**: `i` is the fast pointer. It iterates through the remaining elements of the array, starting from the third element (index 2).

4.  **`if(nums[i] != nums[ind-2])`**: This is the core logic. We check if the current element `nums[i]` is different from the element two positions behind the slow pointer `nums[ind-2]`.  If it is different, it means `nums[i]` is not a third occurrence of the element that's two positions back.

5.  **`nums[ind++] = nums[i];`**: If the condition in the `if` statement is true, we copy the current element `nums[i]` to the position pointed to by `ind`, and then increment `ind` to prepare for the next non-duplicate element.

6.  **`return ind;`**:  Finally, we return `ind`, which represents the new length of the modified array.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input array. The fast pointer `i` iterates through the array once. The operations inside the loop (comparison and assignment) take constant time.

*   **Space Complexity:** O(1). We are modifying the array in-place and using only a few extra variables (the pointers `i` and `ind`), which require constant space.
