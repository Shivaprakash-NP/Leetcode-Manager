## Rearrange Array Elements by Sign

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to rearrange an array of integers `nums` such that:

*   Every consecutive pair of numbers have opposite signs.
*   For all positive integers, the relative order must be maintained.
*   For all negative integers, the relative order must be maintained.
*   The array `nums` will have an equal number of positive and negative integers.

In simpler terms, we need to create a new array where positive and negative numbers alternate while preserving the original order of positive numbers among themselves and negative numbers among themselves.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is to iterate through the input array `nums` and place the positive and negative numbers into their correct positions in a new array `ans`. Since we know the array must alternate signs and the number of positive and negative numbers are equal, we can dedicate specific indices in `ans` for positive and negative numbers.

*   We maintain two separate index pointers: `pp` for positive numbers (starting at index 0) and `np` for negative numbers (starting at index 1).
*   As we iterate through `nums`, if we encounter a positive number, we place it at index `pp` in `ans` and increment `pp` by 2 (to maintain alternating pattern).
*   Similarly, if we encounter a negative number, we place it at index `np` in `ans` and increment `np` by 2.

This approach avoids sorting or other complex operations, directly placing elements at their correct locations in the output array, maintaining the relative order within positive and negative groups.  The choice of this approach stems from its efficiency and straightforwardness, directly leveraging the problem's constraints to achieve the desired rearrangement.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Array:** The primary data structure used is an array. `nums` is the input array, and `ans` is the new array to store the rearranged elements.
*   **Iteration:** The main algorithm involves iterating through the `nums` array.
*   **Index Pointers:** We use two index pointers, `pp` and `np`, to keep track of the next available positions for positive and negative numbers respectively in the `ans` array.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] rearrangeArray(int[] nums) {
        int i = 0; // Index for iterating through the input array nums
        int np = 1; // Index for placing negative numbers in the ans array (starts at index 1 for alternating pattern)
        int pp = 0; // Index for placing positive numbers in the ans array (starts at index 0 for alternating pattern)
        int[] ans = new int[nums.length]; // Create a new array of the same size as nums to store the rearranged elements

        while(i<nums.length) // Iterate through the input array nums
        {
            if(nums[i]<0) // Check if the current element is negative
            {
                ans[np] = nums[i];   // Place the negative number at the current index np in the ans array
                np+=2; // Increment np by 2 to move to the next available position for a negative number
            }
            else // If the current element is positive
            {
                ans[pp] = nums[i]; // Place the positive number at the current index pp in the ans array
                pp+=2; // Increment pp by 2 to move to the next available position for a positive number
            }
            i++; // Move to the next element in the input array nums
        }
        return ans; // Return the rearranged array ans
    }
}
```

*   **`int i = 0;`**: Initializes an index `i` to 0, which will be used to iterate through the input array `nums`.
*   **`int np = 1;`**: Initializes an index `np` to 1. This index will be used to place negative numbers in the output array `ans`.  It starts at 1 because the first negative number should occupy the second position (index 1) to create an alternating pattern.
*   **`int pp = 0;`**: Initializes an index `pp` to 0. This index will be used to place positive numbers in the output array `ans`. It starts at 0 because the first positive number should occupy the first position (index 0) to create an alternating pattern.
*   **`int[] ans = new int[nums.length];`**: Creates a new integer array `ans` with the same length as `nums`. This array will store the rearranged elements.
*   **`while(i<nums.length)`**: This loop iterates through the input array `nums`.
*   **`if(nums[i]<0)`**: Checks if the current element `nums[i]` is negative.
    *   **`ans[np] = nums[i];`**: If the element is negative, it's placed at the index `np` in the `ans` array.
    *   **`np+=2;`**: The `np` index is incremented by 2 to move to the next available position for a negative number (maintaining the alternating pattern).
*   **`else`**: If the current element `nums[i]` is not negative (i.e., it's positive).
    *   **`ans[pp] = nums[i];`**: The element is placed at the index `pp` in the `ans` array.
    *   **`pp+=2;`**: The `pp` index is incremented by 2 to move to the next available position for a positive number (maintaining the alternating pattern).
*   **`i++;`**: The `i` index is incremented to move to the next element in the input array `nums`.
*   **`return ans;`**: After the loop finishes, the function returns the rearranged array `ans`.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the length of the input array `nums`.  This is because we iterate through the array once.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(N), where N is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because we create a new array `ans` of the same size to store the rearranged elements. Although the problem could potentially be solved in-place (without using extra space), the given solution utilizes extra space for clarity and conciseness.  An in-place solution would be significantly more complex.
