## LeetCode: Reorder List - Detailed Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to reorder a given singly linked list such that the nodes are rearranged in the following order: `head -> last -> head.next -> second_to_last -> head.next.next -> third_to_last ...` and so on.  If the list has an odd number of nodes, the middle node remains in its original position.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution uses a three-step approach:

1. **Find the middle:**  It employs a fast and slow pointer technique (`f` and `s`) to efficiently locate the middle of the linked list.  The fast pointer moves twice as fast as the slow pointer. When the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer will be at or just before the middle.

2. **Reverse the second half:** The `rev()` function reverses the second half of the list (from the middle node onwards). This is crucial for interleaving the nodes.

3. **Merge the two halves:** The algorithm then merges the first half and the reversed second half by interleaving their nodes.  It iteratively connects the head of the first half to the head of the reversed second half, then the next node of the first half to the next node of the reversed second half, and so on, until one of the halves is exhausted.

This approach is chosen because it's efficient. Finding the middle and reversing a portion of the list can be done in linear time, and merging the two halves also takes linear time.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:** Singly linked list.
* **Algorithms:**  Fast and slow pointers for finding the middle, iterative linked list reversal, and iterative merging of two linked lists.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **`rev(ListNode cur)`:** This function reverses a linked list iteratively.  It uses three pointers: `cur` (current node), `pre` (previous node), and `t` (temporary node to store the next node). The loop iterates until `cur` reaches the end of the list, reversing the links at each step.

* **`reorderList(ListNode head)`:**
    * **Base Case:** Handles empty or single-node lists.
    * **Find Middle:** Uses fast and slow pointers (`f` and `s`) to find the middle of the list. The condition `f != null && f.next != null && null != f.next.next` ensures the fast pointer doesn't go out of bounds.
    * **Reverse Second Half:** Calls `rev(s.next)` to reverse the second half of the list. `s.next = null` disconnects the first and second halves.
    * **Merge Halves:** Iteratively merges the first half (`fh`) and the reversed second half (`sh`). It uses temporary pointers `n1` and `n2` to store the next nodes in each half to avoid losing the links. The loop continues until either half is empty.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list. Finding the middle, reversing the second half, and merging the halves all take linear time.

* **Space Complexity:** O(1). The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input size.  It only uses a few pointers to manipulate the linked list; no additional data structures that scale with input size are used.

In summary, this Java code provides an efficient and elegant solution to the Reorder List problem by cleverly utilizing fast and slow pointers, list reversal, and merging techniques. The time and space complexities are optimal for this problem.
