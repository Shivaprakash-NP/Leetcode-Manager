## LeetCode Problem: Count the Number of Fair Pairs - Detailed Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to count the number of "fair pairs" in an array `nums`. A pair `(i, j)` is considered fair if `i < j` and `lower <= nums[i] + nums[j] <= upper`, where `lower` and `upper` are given integers. We need to return the total count of such fair pairs.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The main idea is to use a two-pointer approach after sorting the input array `nums`.  We are trying to efficiently count how many pairs satisfy the given sum condition. The naive approach of checking all possible pairs would be O(n^2), which might be too slow for larger inputs.

Sorting allows us to use the fact that if `nums[l] + nums[r]` is too small, then increasing `l` (moving to a larger number) might bring the sum into the desired range. Similarly, if `nums[l] + nums[r]` is too large, then decreasing `r` (moving to a smaller number) might bring the sum into the range.

To count the fair pairs between `lower` and `upper`, we can calculate the count of pairs where the sum is less than or equal to `upper`, and then subtract the count of pairs where the sum is less than `lower`. This gives us the count of pairs that lie in the range `[lower, upper]`.  Effectively, we are using inclusion-exclusion principle.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structure:** Primarily uses an array (`nums`) and integers for storing counts and indices.
*   **Algorithms:**
    *   **Sorting:** The `Arrays.sort(nums)` method is used to sort the input array. This enables the two-pointer approach.
    *   **Two Pointers:**  The two-pointer technique is used to efficiently find pairs that satisfy the sum conditions.
    *   **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:** Applied by finding counts <= `upper`, and <= `lower - 1`, and then subtracting the latter from the former.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public long countFairPairs(int[] nums, int lower, int upper) {
        Arrays.sort(nums); // Sort the input array in ascending order.
        int l = 0;
        int r = nums.length-1;
        long ans1 = 0; // Initialize the count of pairs with sum <= upper.
        while(l<r)
        {
            if(nums[l]+nums[r]<=upper) // If the sum of elements at l and r is <= upper
            {
                ans1+=r-l; // Increment the count by the number of elements between l and r (exclusive of l). Because all numbers between l and r will make valid pairs with l.
                l++; // Move the left pointer to the right, looking for a larger number.
            }
            else r--; // If the sum is > upper, move the right pointer to the left to decrease the sum.
        }
        long ans2 = 0; // Initialize the count of pairs with sum <= lower - 1.
        l = 0;
        r = nums.length - 1;
        while(l<r)
        {
            if(nums[l]+nums[r]<=lower - 1) // If the sum of elements at l and r is <= lower - 1
            {
                ans2+=r-l; // Increment the count by the number of elements between l and r (exclusive of l).
                l++; // Move the left pointer to the right, looking for a larger number.
            }
            else r--; // If the sum is > lower - 1, move the right pointer to the left to decrease the sum.
        }
        return (ans1-ans2); // Return the difference between the two counts, which gives the count of fair pairs.
    }
}
```

*   **`Arrays.sort(nums);`**: Sorts the input array `nums` in ascending order. This is crucial for the two-pointer approach to work efficiently.
*   **`int l = 0; int r = nums.length - 1;`**: Initializes two pointers, `l` and `r`, to the start and end of the sorted array, respectively.
*   **`long ans1 = 0;`**: Initializes a variable `ans1` to store the count of pairs whose sum is less than or equal to `upper`.  We use `long` to avoid potential integer overflow.
*   **`while (l < r)`**: The main loop continues as long as the left pointer `l` is less than the right pointer `r`.
*   **`if (nums[l] + nums[r] <= upper)`**:  Checks if the sum of elements at the left and right pointers is less than or equal to `upper`.
    *   **`ans1 += r - l;`**: If the sum is within the upper bound, it means that all elements between `l+1` and `r` (inclusive) form a fair pair with `nums[l]`. So, we add `r - l` to `ans1`.
    *   **`l++;`**: Move the left pointer to the right to potentially find more pairs whose sum is within the range.
*   **`else r--;`**: If the sum is greater than `upper`, move the right pointer to the left to decrease the sum.
*   The code then repeats a similar process for counting pairs whose sum is less than or equal to `lower - 1`, storing the count in `ans2`.
*   **`return (ans1 - ans2);`**: Finally, the function returns the difference between `ans1` and `ans2`. This gives the number of pairs whose sum is between `lower` and `upper` (inclusive), representing the "fair pairs".

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:**
    *   `Arrays.sort(nums)`: O(n log n), where n is the length of the input array.
    *   The two `while` loops each run in O(n) time in the worst case.
    *   Therefore, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, which is **O(n log n)**.

*   **Space Complexity:**
    *   The space complexity is **O(1)** because we are using a constant amount of extra space for variables like `l`, `r`, `ans1`, and `ans2`. The sorting is done in-place by `Arrays.sort` in Java's implementation, contributing O(1) space. Some sorting algorithms could take O(n) space. It should be noted what implementation one uses.
