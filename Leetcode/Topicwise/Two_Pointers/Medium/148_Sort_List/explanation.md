## LeetCode Problem: Sort List - Detailed Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to sort a singly linked list in ascending order. We need to rearrange the nodes of the linked list such that their values are in non-decreasing order.  The original structure of the linked list should be modified; we're not just extracting the values, sorting them, and creating a new list.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The chosen approach is **Merge Sort**. Here's why Merge Sort is suitable:

*   **Well-suited for Linked Lists:** Merge sort naturally lends itself to linked lists. Unlike algorithms like quicksort, merge sort doesn't require random access, which is inefficient in a linked list. We can split and merge sublists efficiently.
*   **Stable Sort:** Merge sort is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that elements with equal values maintain their relative order after sorting.
*   **Divide and Conquer:**  Merge sort follows the divide-and-conquer paradigm, recursively breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems until they become trivial to solve, and then merging the sorted subproblems.

The core idea is:

1.  **Divide:** Split the linked list into two roughly equal halves.
2.  **Conquer:** Recursively sort each half.
3.  **Merge:** Merge the two sorted halves into a single sorted linked list.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structure:** Singly Linked List (`ListNode`)
*   **Algorithms:**
    *   **Merge Sort:** The primary sorting algorithm.
    *   **Fast and Slow Pointers:** Used to find the middle of the linked list efficiently.
    *   **Merge Operation:** Merges two sorted linked lists.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }

class Solution {
    private ListNode findmiddle(ListNode head)
    {
        ListNode s = head;
        ListNode f = head;
        while(f.next != null && f.next.next != null)
        {
            s = s.next;
            f = f.next.next;
        }
        return s;
    }
    private ListNode merge(ListNode lhead , ListNode rhead)
    {
        ListNode dum = new ListNode(-1);
        ListNode tem = dum;
        while(lhead != null && rhead != null)
        {
            if(lhead.val < rhead.val) 
            {
                tem.next = lhead;
                lhead = lhead.next;
            }
            else
            {
                tem.next = rhead;
                rhead = rhead.next;
            }
            tem = tem.next;
        }
        if(lhead == null) tem.next = rhead;
        else tem.next = lhead;
        return dum.next;
    }
    private ListNode ms(ListNode head)
    {
        if(head == null || head.next == null) return head;
        ListNode m = findmiddle(head);
        ListNode lhead = head;
        ListNode rhead = m.next;
        m.next = null;
        lhead = ms(lhead);
        rhead = ms(rhead);
        return merge(lhead , rhead);
    }
    public ListNode sortList(ListNode head) {
        if(head == null || head.next == null) return head;
        return ms(head);
    }
}
```

*   **`ListNode` Class:** This is the standard definition for a node in a singly linked list.  It contains an integer value (`val`) and a pointer to the next node (`next`).

*   **`findmiddle(ListNode head)`:**
    *   **Purpose:** This function finds the middle node of the linked list.
    *   **Logic:** It uses the fast and slow pointer technique. The `f` pointer moves two steps at a time, while the `s` pointer moves one step at a time. When `f` reaches the end of the list, `s` will be at the middle.
    *   **Return Value:** Returns the middle node of the list.

*   **`merge(ListNode lhead, ListNode rhead)`:**
    *   **Purpose:** This function merges two sorted linked lists (`lhead` and `rhead`) into a single sorted linked list.
    *   **Logic:**
        *   `dum = new ListNode(-1);`: Creates a dummy node to simplify the merging process.  The `dum` node's `next` will point to the head of the merged list.
        *   `tem = dum;`: `tem` is a pointer that iterates through the merged list.
        *   The `while` loop compares the values of the current nodes in `lhead` and `rhead`. The smaller value is appended to the `tem.next`, and the respective pointer (`lhead` or `rhead`) is advanced.
        *   After one list is exhausted, the remaining nodes of the other list are appended to the merged list.
    *   **Return Value:**  Returns the head of the merged linked list (which is `dum.next`).

*   **`ms(ListNode head)`:**
    *   **Purpose:** This is the recursive merge sort function.
    *   **Base Case:** `if(head == null || head.next == null) return head;`: If the list is empty or has only one element, it's already sorted, so return it.
    *   **Divide:**
        *   `ListNode m = findmiddle(head);`: Finds the middle node.
        *   `ListNode lhead = head;`:  `lhead` is the head of the left sublist (from head to mid).
        *   `ListNode rhead = m.next;`: `rhead` is the head of the right sublist (from mid.next to end).
        *   `m.next = null;`: Important step: This severs the connection between the left and right sublists, creating two independent lists.
    *   **Conquer:**
        *   `lhead = ms(lhead);`: Recursively sorts the left sublist.
        *   `rhead = ms(rhead);`: Recursively sorts the right sublist.
    *   **Merge:**
        *   `return merge(lhead , rhead);`: Merges the two sorted sublists.

*   **`sortList(ListNode head)`:**
    *   **Purpose:** This is the main function that initiates the sorting process.
    *   **Logic:**
        *   `if(head == null || head.next == null) return head;`: Checks for empty or single-element lists (base case).
        *   `return ms(head);`: Calls the recursive merge sort function `ms` to sort the list.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n log n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.
    *   The `findmiddle` function takes O(n) time.
    *   The `merge` function takes O(n) time.
    *   The `ms` (merge sort) function recursively divides the list into halves (log n levels), and at each level, it merges the sublists (O(n) time).
    *   Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n log n).

*   **Space Complexity:** O(log n)
    *   Merge Sort has a recursive nature, and the depth of the recursion is log n in the average and best cases.  Each recursive call consumes some stack space. So, the space complexity due to the recursive calls is O(log n). This assumes a balanced division of the list.
    *   The `merge` function uses O(1) extra space.
    *   Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(log n) due to recursion stack space.
