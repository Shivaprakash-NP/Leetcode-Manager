## Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to find the starting index of the first occurrence of a `needle` string within a `haystack` string. If the `needle` is not found in the `haystack`, we should return -1.  This is essentially a string searching problem.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The provided code utilizes the built-in `indexOf()` method available in Java's `String` class. This method directly implements the string searching functionality we need. The intuition behind using `indexOf()` is its efficiency and simplicity. It avoids the need to implement a manual string searching algorithm like brute-force or KMP, allowing for a concise and readable solution. It leverages optimized, pre-built functionality.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:** String (fundamental Java data structure).
*   **Algorithms:** The `indexOf()` method internally uses an efficient string searching algorithm (likely a variation of Boyer-Moore or similar). While we don't see the explicit algorithm in the code, it's crucial to understand it's being used behind the scenes by the `indexOf` method to implement the search functionality.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int strStr(String haystack, String needle) {
        return haystack.indexOf(needle);
    }
}
```

*   **`class Solution { ... }`**: This defines a class named `Solution`, which is standard practice in LeetCode for organizing the solution code.
*   **`public int strStr(String haystack, String needle) { ... }`**: This defines the main method, `strStr`, which takes two strings as input: `haystack` (the string to search within) and `needle` (the string to search for). It returns an integer representing the index of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`, or -1 if `needle` is not found.
*   **`return haystack.indexOf(needle);`**: This is the core of the solution.  It calls the `indexOf()` method on the `haystack` string, passing the `needle` string as an argument.  The `indexOf()` method searches for the first occurrence of `needle` within `haystack`.  If found, it returns the starting index of the occurrence. If not found, it returns -1.  The returned value is then directly returned by the `strStr` method.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is dominated by the `indexOf()` method.  Java's `indexOf()` implementation typically uses an optimized string searching algorithm, such as a variant of the Boyer-Moore algorithm or similar.  In the best case (e.g., `needle` is empty or at the very beginning of `haystack`), the time complexity could be close to O(1). In the worst case (e.g., `needle` is almost a perfect match but fails at the very end, or `needle` is not found and requires searching the entire haystack), the time complexity is O(m*n) where n is the length of haystack and m is the length of needle.  However, in practice, `indexOf()` is highly optimized, so its performance is generally much better than a naive brute-force approach.  Therefore, we can consider the average-case time complexity closer to O(n) where n is the length of haystack, if the underlying implementation of `indexOf()` is based on algorithms like Boyer-Moore.

*   **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(1) (constant).  The algorithm uses a fixed amount of extra space, regardless of the size of the input strings.  The `indexOf()` method might use some internal temporary variables, but their space requirements are constant. We are not creating any new data structures that scale with the input size.
