## LeetCode: Remove Element - Detailed Solution Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The "Remove Element" problem asks us to remove all occurrences of a specific value (`val`) from an integer array (`nums`) *in-place*.  This means we should modify the original array directly, without creating a completely new array. The function should return the new length of the array after removing the specified value.  Note that the order of the remaining elements doesn't need to be preserved.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The provided Java code uses a two-pass approach.  It first iterates through the input array, creating a new `ArrayList` containing only the elements that are *not* equal to the target value (`val`).  Then, it iterates through the original array again, populating it with the elements from the `ArrayList`. Any remaining positions in the original array are filled with 0s.

While this approach works, it's not the most efficient solution for this problem.  Creating an entirely new `ArrayList` adds unnecessary space complexity. A more optimal approach would be to use a two-pointer technique (or a single-pass approach) to remove elements in-place.

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:** The code uses an `int` array (`nums`) to store the input and an `ArrayList<Integer>` (`ans`) to temporarily store elements that are not equal to `val`.
* **Algorithms:** The core algorithm is a simple linear scan (iteration) of the array. The approach is essentially a filtering operation followed by an array overwrite.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

```java
class Solution {
    public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
        ArrayList<Integer> ans = new ArrayList(); // Create an ArrayList to store elements != val
        for(int i = 0 ; i<nums.length ; i++) { // First pass: Filter elements
            if(nums[i]!=val) ans.add(nums[i]); 
        }
        for(int i = 0 ; i<nums.length ; i++) { // Second pass: Overwrite original array
            if(i<ans.size())
                nums[i] = ans.get(i); // Copy from ArrayList
            else
                nums[i] = 0; // Fill remaining with 0s
        }
        return ans.size(); // Return the new length (size of ArrayList)
    }
}
```

* **Lines 3-5:** An `ArrayList` named `ans` is initialized.  The first loop iterates through the input array `nums`. If an element is not equal to `val`, it's added to `ans`.
* **Lines 6-10:** The second loop iterates through `nums` again. If the index `i` is within the bounds of `ans`, the element at index `i` in `ans` is copied to the same index in `nums`. Otherwise, the remaining elements in `nums` are set to 0.
* **Line 11:** The size of `ans` (which represents the number of elements not equal to `val`) is returned.

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because the code iterates through the array twice.
* **Space Complexity:** O(n) in the worst case. This is because the `ArrayList` `ans` can potentially store all elements of the input array if `val` is not present in the array. A better approach would have O(1) space complexity.


**Improved Solution (In-place with Two Pointers):**

A significantly more efficient solution would use two pointers: one to iterate through the array and another to track the index where the next non-`val` element should be placed.  This eliminates the need for extra space.

```java
class Solution {
    public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
        int k = 0; // Pointer for the next position of non-val element
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] != val) {
                nums[k++] = nums[i];
            }
        }
        return k;
    }
}
```

This improved solution has O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity, making it much more efficient than the original code.
