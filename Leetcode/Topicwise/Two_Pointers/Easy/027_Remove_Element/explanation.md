## LeetCode: Remove Element - Detailed Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The "Remove Element" problem asks us to remove all occurrences of a specific value (`val`) from an integer array (`nums`) *in-place*.  This means we should modify the original array directly, without creating a completely new array. The function should return the new length of the array after removing the elements.  Note that the order of the remaining elements doesn't need to be preserved.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The provided Java code uses a two-pass approach.  First, it iterates through the input array and adds all elements *except* the target value (`val`) to a new `ArrayList`. This effectively filters out the unwanted elements. Then, it copies the elements from the `ArrayList` back into the original array, filling the remaining spaces with 0s. This ensures the function modifies the input array in-place as required.

While functional, this approach is not the most efficient.  A more optimal approach would be to use a single pass and overwrite elements directly within the `nums` array, using two pointers. However, let's analyze the given code first.

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:** The primary data structure used is an `ArrayList` of integers.  This dynamic array provides flexibility in adding elements as we filter.  The input `nums` array is also crucial.
* **Algorithms:** The core algorithm is a simple linear scan (two passes) through the input array.  No sophisticated algorithms are employed here.

**4. Code Walkthrough:**

```java
class Solution {
    public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
        ArrayList<Integer> ans = new ArrayList(); // Creates an empty ArrayList to store filtered elements.
        for(int i = 0 ; i<nums.length ; i++) // First pass: Iterate through the input array.
        {
            if(nums[i]!=val) ans.add(nums[i]); // If the element is not the target value, add it to the ArrayList.
        }
        for(int i = 0 ; i<nums.length ; i++) // Second pass: Iterate through the input array again.
        {
            if(i<ans.size()) // If we haven't reached the end of the filtered elements
                nums[i] = ans.get(i); // Copy the element from ArrayList to the original array.
            else
                nums[i] = 0; // Fill the remaining spaces with 0s.
        }
        return ans.size(); // Return the number of elements after removal (size of the ArrayList).
    }
}
```

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`.  The code iterates through the array twice.  While the ArrayList's `add` operation has an amortized time complexity of O(1), the overall complexity is still dominated by the two linear scans.

* **Space Complexity:** O(n) in the worst case. The `ArrayList` `ans` can store up to n elements if `val` is not present in the array.  This makes the space complexity directly proportional to the input size.  A better approach would achieve O(1) space complexity.


**Improved Solution (O(1) space):**

A significantly more efficient solution would use two pointers: one to iterate through the array, and another to track the index where the next non-target element should be placed. This avoids the extra space used by the ArrayList.

```java
class Solution {
    public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
        int k = 0; // Pointer to track the index for non-target elements.
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] != val) {
                nums[k++] = nums[i]; // Overwrite nums[k] with the non-target element and increment k.
            }
        }
        return k; // k now represents the new length of the array.
    }
}
```

This improved solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), making it far superior to the original code.  It directly addresses the problem's requirement of an in-place solution with optimal space usage.
