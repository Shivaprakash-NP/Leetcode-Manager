## LeetCode Problem: Apply Operations to an Array - Explained

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem states that we're given an integer array `nums`. We need to perform two operations on it:

1.  **Apply Operations:** Iterate through the array. If `nums[i]` is equal to `nums[i+1]`, multiply `nums[i]` by 2 and set `nums[i+1]` to 0. Do this for all `i` from 0 to `n-2`.
2.  **Move Zeros:** After the first operation, move all the non-zero elements to the beginning of the array, filling the remaining positions with zeros.

The task is to return the modified array.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The chosen approach directly implements the operations described in the problem statement. It breaks the problem into two distinct phases:

*   **Phase 1: Applying the Operations:** This is a straightforward linear scan. We iterate through the array and perform the multiplication and zeroing as specified.

*   **Phase 2: Moving Zeros:** Instead of creating a new array or performing many swaps, we use a two-pointer technique. One pointer (`ind`) keeps track of the next position to place a non-zero element. We iterate through the array; whenever we find a non-zero element, we move it to `nums[ind]` and increment `ind`.  After the first iteration is complete, all non-zero elements are at the beginning. Then, in the last `while` loop, we iterate and place 0 at the positions after the last non-zero element.

This approach is efficient because it modifies the array in-place, minimizing memory usage and avoiding unnecessary data copying.  It's also easy to understand and implement.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structure:** The primary data structure is the input array `nums` itself.
*   **Algorithms:**
    *   **Linear Scan (Iteration):** The core algorithm involves iterating through the array multiple times to apply operations and rearrange elements.
    *   **Two-Pointer Technique:**  The zero-moving phase employs a two-pointer technique to efficiently move non-zero elements to the front of the array.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] applyOperations(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length; 
        // Phase 1: Apply the operations
        for(int i = 0 ; i<n-1 ; i++)
        {
            if(nums[i]==nums[i+1])
            {
                nums[i]*=2;
                nums[i+1]=0;
            }
        }
        // Phase 2: Move non-zero elements to the beginning
        int ind = 0;
        for(int v : nums) if(v!=0) nums[ind++] = v;
        // Fill the remaining positions with zeros
        while(ind<n) nums[ind++] = 0;
        return nums;
    }
}
```

1.  **`int n = nums.length;`**: This line retrieves the length of the input array `nums` and stores it in the variable `n`. This is done for efficiency, as we'll be using the length multiple times.

2.  **`for(int i = 0 ; i<n-1 ; i++)`**: This loop iterates through the array `nums` from index 0 up to `n-2`. We stop at `n-2` because we need to compare each element with the *next* element (`nums[i+1]`).

3.  **`if(nums[i]==nums[i+1])`**:  This condition checks if the current element `nums[i]` is equal to the next element `nums[i+1]`.

4.  **`nums[i]*=2;`**: If the condition is true, this line doubles the value of the current element `nums[i]`. This is equivalent to `nums[i] = nums[i] * 2;`.

5.  **`nums[i+1]=0;`**:  If the condition is true, this line sets the value of the next element `nums[i+1]` to 0.

6.  **`int ind = 0;`**: This line initializes a variable `ind` to 0. This variable will serve as a pointer to the next available position in the array where we can place a non-zero element.

7.  **`for(int v : nums) if(v!=0) nums[ind++] = v;`**: This loop iterates through the array `nums` using an enhanced for loop (also known as a "for-each" loop). For each element `v` in `nums`:
    *   **`if(v!=0)`**: This condition checks if the element `v` is not equal to 0.
    *   **`nums[ind++] = v;`**: If the element `v` is not zero, this line places it at the position `nums[ind]` and then increments `ind`. The post-increment operator `ind++` means that `ind` is incremented *after* its current value is used as the array index.

8.  **`while(ind<n) nums[ind++] = 0;`**: This loop continues filling the remaining positions in the array with zeros.
    *   **`while(ind<n)`**: The loop continues as long as `ind` is less than the length of the array `n`.  This ensures that all positions after the last non-zero element are filled with zeros.
    *   **`nums[ind++] = 0;`**: This line sets the value at position `nums[ind]` to 0 and then increments `ind`.

9.  **`return nums;`**: This line returns the modified array `nums`.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the array. The algorithm iterates through the array a maximum of three times (once for applying the operations, once for moving non-zero elements, and once for filling with zeros). The number of operations is directly proportional to the size of the input array.

*   **Space Complexity:** O(1). The algorithm modifies the array in-place, meaning it doesn't use any additional data structures that scale with the input size. We only use a few constant-sized variables like `n` and `ind`, so the space complexity is constant.
