### 1. Intuition

Imagine a network of computers represented by nodes and connections.  A critical connection is an edge (connection) whose removal would disconnect the network.  This solution uses Tarjan's algorithm, a depth-first search (DFS)-based approach, to efficiently identify these critical connections.  Think of it like exploring the network systematically:  If removing a connection increases the minimum time needed to reach a node from a starting point, that connection is critical because it's the only path to that part of the network.


### 2. Approach

The algorithm employs a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal to explore the network.  Key to the algorithm are two arrays:

* **`time`**: Stores the discovery time of each node during the DFS.  The lower the value, the earlier the node was discovered.
* **`low`**: Stores the lowest discovery time reachable from a node, considering both its descendants and its ancestors through back edges (edges that connect to a node's ancestor in the DFS tree).

The DFS process works as follows:

1. **Initialization:**  The `time` array is initialized to -1 (representing undiscovered nodes), and the `low` array is initialized to a large value.  An adjacency list `adj` is created to represent the graph efficiently.

2. **DFS Traversal:** The `dfs` function recursively explores the graph.  For each node:
   - It assigns a discovery time (`time[node]`) and initializes `low[node]` to the discovery time.
   - It iterates through the neighbors (`v`) of the current node.
   - **If a neighbor is undiscovered (`time[v] == -1`):**  It recursively calls `dfs` on the neighbor.  Crucially, after the recursive call, it updates `low[node]` to be the minimum of `low[node]` and `low[v]`. This step captures the lowest reachable discovery time through the subtree rooted at the neighbor `v`.
   - **If the condition `low[v] > time[node]` holds:** This implies that there's no way to reach node `v` (or a node with an even earlier discovery time) from anywhere else other than through `node`. Removing the edge (`node`, `v`) would therefore disconnect the network, marking it as a critical connection.

3. **Critical Connection Identification:** If a connection satisfies `low[v] > time[node]`, it is added to the `ans` list.


### 3. Data Structures

* **`ans` (List<List<Integer>>):** Stores the critical connections as pairs of nodes (List<Integer>).
* **`time` (int[]):** Array to store the discovery time of each node during the DFS.
* **`low` (int[]):** Array to store the lowest discovery time reachable from each node.
* **`adj` (ArrayList<Integer>[]):**  An adjacency list representation of the graph. This is an array of ArrayLists, where each index `i` represents node `i`, and the ArrayList at index `i` contains the nodes adjacent to node `i`.  This efficient data structure allows for quick access to neighbors during DFS traversal.


### 4. Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(V + E), where V is the number of nodes (vertices) and E is the number of edges in the graph. This is because the algorithm performs a single DFS traversal, visiting each node and edge exactly once.

- **Space Complexity:** O(V + E). The space is dominated by the `adj` adjacency list (which stores E edges), the `time` and `low` arrays (each of size V), and the recursion stack (which in the worst case can be of size V). The `ans` list can also grow to contain at most E edges.  Therefore, the overall space complexity is linear in the size of the input graph.
