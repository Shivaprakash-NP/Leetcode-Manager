### 1. Intuition

Imagine you have a network of computers (nodes) that you want to connect.  Each connection between two computers is represented by a cable (edge).  The goal is to determine the minimum number of additional cables needed to make the entire network connected – meaning every computer can communicate with every other computer.  This problem uses a technique called Union-Find to efficiently determine the number of connected components in the network.  If we don't have enough cables to even connect the components, we can't possibly make the network connected.

This solution uses the Union-Find algorithm, a clever way to track connected components in a graph.  Think of it like merging islands: if two islands are connected by a bridge, we merge them into a single, larger island.  We continue this process until we've identified all the distinct islands (connected components) in the network.

### 2. Approach

The algorithm proceeds as follows:

1. **Check for feasibility:** If the number of connections is less than `n - 1`, where `n` is the number of computers, it's impossible to connect the network, so we return `-1`.  A connected graph with `n` nodes requires at least `n - 1` edges.

2. **Initialize Union-Find:** We initialize a `parent` array to track the root node of each connected component and a `size` array to track the size of each component.  Initially, each node is its own component.

3. **Iterate through connections:** We iterate through the list of connections (`connections`). For each connection (`u`, `v`), we attempt to unite the components containing nodes `u` and `v` using the `union` function.

4. **Union-Find Operation:** The `union` function uses the `find` function to determine the root nodes of the components containing `u` and `v`. If these root nodes are different (meaning the components are separate), it merges the components by updating the `parent` array and `size` array.  The `size` array is used for union by rank (explained below), improving performance.  If the root nodes are the same, it means the nodes are already connected, so nothing needs to be done.  The `union` function returns `true` if a merge occurred and `false` otherwise.

5. **Count connected components:** The variable `ans` starts as `n` (the number of initial components). Each successful `union` operation reduces the number of components by 1.

6. **Return the result:** Finally, we subtract 1 from `ans` to get the number of additional cables needed.  Subtracting 1 accounts for the fact that we've already considered the existing connections.

### 3. Data Structures

* **`parent` array (int[]):** This array stores the parent node of each node in the Union-Find data structure.  `parent[i] = i` initially indicates that node `i` is the root of its own component.  During the union operation, this array is modified to reflect the merging of components.

* **`size` array (int[]):** This array stores the size of each component. It is used to perform union by rank (or union by size), which significantly optimizes the performance of the Union-Find algorithm. When merging components, we always attach the smaller component to the larger one, reducing the height of the tree and making future `find` operations faster.

### 4. Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** O(Nα(N)), where N is the number of nodes (computers) and α(N) is the inverse Ackermann function.  The inverse Ackermann function grows incredibly slowly, so for all practical purposes, it can be considered a constant. The time complexity is dominated by the Union-Find operations.  The `find` operation has a time complexity of almost O(1) due to path compression.

* **Space Complexity:** O(N) due to the `parent` and `size` arrays, both of which have a size equal to the number of nodes in the network.

In summary, this solution uses the Union-Find algorithm to efficiently determine the minimum number of additional cables needed to connect a network of computers.  The use of union by size optimization significantly improves the algorithm's performance.  The solution elegantly handles the edge case where it's impossible to connect the network.
