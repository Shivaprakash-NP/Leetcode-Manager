## Set Matrix Zeroes - Detailed Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The "Set Matrix Zeroes" problem asks us to modify a given m x n matrix. If any element in the matrix is 0, we need to set its entire row and column to 0. We must do this in place, meaning we should modify the original matrix directly without using extra space proportional to the size of the matrix (ideally, constant space).

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The straightforward approach of using auxiliary arrays to store the rows and columns to be zeroed out requires O(m+n) space. The key idea behind this optimized solution is to use the first row and the first column of the matrix itself as markers to indicate which rows and columns should be set to zero.

Here's the intuition:

1.  **Marking:** We iterate through the matrix. If we find a `0` at `matrix[i][j]`, we mark the `i`th row and `j`th column by setting `matrix[i][0]` and `matrix[0][j]` to `0`. This essentially uses the first row and column as "flags".
2.  **Handling Edge Cases:** Since `matrix[0][0]` is used by both the first row and first column, we need a separate variable (`v`) to track if the first column should be set to zero. This avoids incorrectly setting the first row to zero if only the first column contained a zero.
3.  **Zeroing:** After marking, we iterate through the matrix starting from index (1, 1). If `matrix[i][0]` or `matrix[0][j]` is `0`, we set `matrix[i][j]` to `0`.
4.  **First Row and Column:** Finally, we need to zero out the first row and the first column based on whether `matrix[0][0]` was `0` (which is implied if any entry in the first row was zero during marking) and the `v` value respectively.

Why this approach? It minimizes space complexity by leveraging the existing matrix structure, using the first row and column as flags. It avoids allocating extra memory.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:** The primary data structure used is a 2D integer array (`int[][] matrix`).
*   **Algorithms:** The algorithm primarily relies on iterative traversal and in-place modification.  No complex algorithm like sorting or searching is used.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public void setZeroes(int[][] matrix) {
        int m = matrix.length;
        int n = matrix[0].length;
        int v = 1; // Flag for the first column (initially assumed no zero)

        // Phase 1: Marking rows and columns using the first row and column
        for(int i = 0 ; i<m ; i++) {
            for(int j = 0 ; j<n ; j++) {
                if(matrix[i][j] == 0) {
                    if(j != 0) { // If not in the first column
                        matrix[i][0] = 0; // Mark the row
                        matrix[0][j] = 0; // Mark the column
                    } else { // If in the first column
                        v = 0; // Mark that the first column needs to be zeroed
                        matrix[i][0] = 0; //redundant, but keeps logic clean. Marks the row
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        // Phase 2: Setting zeroes based on the first row
        for(int i = 1 ; i<n ; i++) {
            if(matrix[0][i] == 0) { //If column 'i' needs to be zeroed
                for(int j = 1 ; j<m ; j++) matrix[j][i] = 0; // Zero out that column (excluding first row)
            }
        }

        // Phase 3: Setting zeroes based on the first column
        for(int i = 0 ; i<m ; i++) {
            if(matrix[i][0] == 0) { //If row 'i' needs to be zeroed
                for(int j = 1 ; j<n ; j++) matrix[i][j] = 0; // Zero out that row (excluding first column)
            }
        }

        // Phase 4: Setting first column to zero if necessary
        if(v == 0) {
            for(int i = 0 ; i<m ; i++) matrix[i][0] = 0; // Zero out the first column
        }
    }
}
```

**Detailed Breakdown:**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   `m`: Stores the number of rows in the matrix.
    *   `n`: Stores the number of columns in the matrix.
    *   `v`:  This variable acts as a flag. It's initialized to 1, indicating that initially, we assume the first column should not be set to zero. If we encounter a zero in the first column, `v` will be set to 0.

2.  **Marking Phase (Outer Loop):**
    *   The nested `for` loops iterate through each element `matrix[i][j]` of the matrix.
    *   `if (matrix[i][j] == 0)`: If we find a zero, we need to mark the corresponding row and column.
        *   `if (j != 0)`: If the zero is not in the first column, we set `matrix[i][0] = 0` (marking the row) and `matrix[0][j] = 0` (marking the column).
        *   `else`: If the zero *is* in the first column, we set the flag `v = 0` to indicate that the first column needs to be zeroed and `matrix[i][0] = 0` (marking the row).

3.  **Zeroing Phase (Columns based on First Row):**
    *   `for(int i = 1 ; i<n ; i++)`: Iterates through the elements of the first row (excluding the first element).
    *   `if(matrix[0][i] == 0)`: If `matrix[0][i]` is zero, it means the `i`-th column should be set to zero.
    *   The inner loop `for(int j = 1 ; j<m ; j++) matrix[j][i] = 0;` sets all elements in the `i`-th column (excluding the first row) to zero.

4.  **Zeroing Phase (Rows based on First Column):**
    *   `for(int i = 0 ; i<m ; i++)`: Iterates through the elements of the first column.
    *   `if(matrix[i][0] == 0)`: If `matrix[i][0]` is zero, it means the `i`-th row should be set to zero.
    *   The inner loop `for(int j = 1 ; j<n ; j++) matrix[i][j] = 0;` sets all elements in the `i`-th row (excluding the first column) to zero.

5.  **Zeroing First Column (Based on Flag):**
    *   `if(v == 0)`: If the flag `v` is 0, it means the first column should be set to zero.
    *   The loop `for(int i = 0 ; i<m ; i++) matrix[i][0] = 0;` sets all elements in the first column to zero.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(m\*n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns. The code iterates through the matrix multiple times, but each iteration takes O(m\*n) time.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1). The algorithm uses only a single integer variable `v` for additional space.  It modifies the matrix in-place, so it doesn't require any extra space proportional to the size of the matrix.
