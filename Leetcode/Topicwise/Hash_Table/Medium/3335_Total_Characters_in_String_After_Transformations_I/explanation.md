## Explanation of LeetCode Problem: Total Characters in String After Transformations I

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to simulate a series of transformations on a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. The transformations are applied `t` times.  In each transformation:

*   Each character `c` at index `i` (where `0 <= i < 25`, representing 'a' to 'y') is replaced by the character at index `i + 1` (so 'a' becomes 'b', 'b' becomes 'c', and so on).
*   Each character 'z' is replaced by both 'a' and 'b'. This means that for every 'z', we add one 'a' and one 'b' to our character counts.

We are given the string `s` and the number of transformations `t`. The final result should be the total number of characters in the string after `t` transformations, modulo `10^9 + 7`. The "total number of characters" translates to summing the count of each character from 'a' to 'z' after the transformations.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The problem describes repeated transformations, which at first glance might suggest directly modifying the string in each transformation. However, modifying the string directly will result in a very inefficient `O(n*t)` solution, where `n` is the length of the string and `t` is the number of transformations. This will likely lead to Time Limit Exceeded (TLE) errors for larger inputs.

Instead, we can focus on tracking the *counts* of each character.  We use an array `val` to store the frequency of each character from 'a' to 'z'. The key idea is that during each transformation, we can update the counts of each character based on the transformation rules, without actually modifying the original string.

Specifically, we iterate from 'a' to 'y'. The new count of each character is the old count of the previous character. The special case of 'z' needs to be handled separately; each 'z' adds one to the count of 'a' and one to the count of 'b'.

The modulo operation `% MOD` is crucial because the number of characters can become very large, potentially overflowing the integer data type. Applying the modulo at each step of the calculations prevents this overflow and ensures the result remains within the desired range.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Array (Frequency Counter):** We use an integer array `val` of size 26 to store the frequency of each character from 'a' to 'z'. This is a standard technique for counting occurrences of elements within a limited range.
*   **Modular Arithmetic:** We use the modulo operator (`%`) to prevent integer overflow.  The modulo operator gives the remainder after division, ensuring that the results stay within the range of `0` to `MOD - 1`.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int lengthAfterTransformations(String s, int t) {
        int[] val = new int[26];
        final int MOD = 1_000_000_007;

        // Count initial character frequencies
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            val[c - 'a']++;
        }

        // Perform transformations t times
        for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
            int[] next = new int[26]; // Array to store counts after transformation

            // Apply transformation rules for 'a' to 'y'
            for (int j = 0; j < 25; j++) {
                if (val[j] > 0) {
                    next[j + 1] = (next[j + 1] + val[j]) % MOD;
                }
            }

            // Apply transformation rules for 'z'
            if (val[25] > 0) {
                next[0] = (next[0] + val[25]) % MOD; // 'z' becomes 'a'
                next[1] = (next[1] + val[25]) % MOD; // 'z' also becomes 'b'
            }

            val = next; // Update the character counts
        }

        // Calculate the total number of characters
        int len = 0;
        for (int v : val) {
            len = (len + v) % MOD;
        }

        return len;
    }
}
```

*   **`int[] val = new int[26];`**: Initializes an integer array `val` of size 26. Each index represents a lowercase English letter (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z').  This array stores the counts of each character.
*   **`final int MOD = 1_000_000_007;`**:  Defines a constant `MOD` representing the modulo value (10^9 + 7).  Using `final` ensures immutability.
*   **`for (char c : s.toCharArray()) { val[c - 'a']++; }`**: This loop iterates through the input string `s`, character by character. `s.toCharArray()` converts the string into an array of characters. `c - 'a'` calculates the index corresponding to the character `c` (e.g., 'b' - 'a' = 1).  `val[c - 'a']++` increments the count for the corresponding character in the `val` array.
*   **`for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) { ... }`**: This outer loop iterates `t` times, performing one transformation in each iteration.
*   **`int[] next = new int[26];`**:  Inside the transformation loop, `next` is a temporary array of the same size as `val`.  It's used to store the updated character counts after applying the transformation for a single iteration. This is needed so we don't overwrite counts before they are processed in the same iteration.
*   **`for (int j = 0; j < 25; j++) { ... }`**: This inner loop iterates through the characters from 'a' to 'y' (index 0 to 24). `next[j + 1] = (next[j + 1] + val[j]) % MOD;`  updates the count of the next character (`j + 1`).  The count of the character at index `j` ('a' + j) is added to the count of the character at index `j + 1` ('a' + j + 1).  The modulo operator is used to prevent overflow.
*   **`if (val[25] > 0) { ... }`**: This `if` statement handles the 'z' character (index 25). Since 'z' transforms into both 'a' and 'b', `next[0]` and `next[1]` are both incremented by the count of 'z'.
*   **`val = next;`**: After processing all characters (a to z) in a single transformation, the `val` array is updated to `next`. This is the critical step where the updated counts are stored for the next transformation.
*   **`int len = 0; for (int v : val) { len = (len + v) % MOD; }`**: After the transformations, this loop calculates the total number of characters by summing the counts in the `val` array.  The modulo operator is used again to prevent overflow.
*   **`return len;`**: Returns the total number of characters (modulo `MOD`).

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** `O(n + t * 26)`, where `n` is the length of the string `s` and `t` is the number of transformations.  The initial counting of characters takes `O(n)` time.  The transformation loop iterates `t` times, and in each iteration, we iterate through the `val` array (which has a fixed size of 26), giving `O(t * 26)` time.  The final summation takes `O(26)` time. Since 26 is constant, we can simplify it to O(n + t).
*   **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`. We use a fixed-size array `val` of size 26 and `next` of size 26. These sizes do not depend on the input size. Therefore, the space complexity is constant.
