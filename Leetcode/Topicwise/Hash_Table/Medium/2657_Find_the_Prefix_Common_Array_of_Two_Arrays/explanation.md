## LeetCode Problem: Find the Prefix Common Array of Two Arrays - Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

Given two integer arrays `A` and `B` of the same length `n`, the goal is to create a new array `C` also of length `n`.  For each index `i` (from 0 to `n-1`), `C[i]` should store the number of common elements in the prefix subarrays `A[0...i]` and `B[0...i]`.  In simpler terms, for each `i`, we need to count how many elements are present in both the first `i+1` elements of array `A` and the first `i+1` elements of array `B`.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The fundamental idea is to iterate through the prefixes of `A` and `B` simultaneously. For each index `i`, we need to determine the common elements between `A[0...i]` and `B[0...i]`. A straightforward way to do this efficiently is by using a hash map (`HashMap`).

The hash map will store the elements we've seen so far in both arrays.  We iterate from `i = 0` to `n-1`.  For each `i`, we add `A[i]` and `B[i]` to the hash map.  If an element is already present in the hash map, its count is incremented.  After processing `A[i]` and `B[i]`, we iterate through the keys of the hash map and count the elements that have a value of 2, indicating they are present in both `A[0...i]` and `B[0...i]`. This count becomes `C[i]`.

Why this approach? Because checking for the presence of an element in a hash map (or incrementing its count) takes, on average, O(1) time. This significantly improves the efficiency compared to searching for elements within the arrays repeatedly.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **`HashMap`**:  Used to store the frequency of elements encountered in the prefixes of `A` and `B`. This allows for efficient counting of common elements.
*   **Iteration**:  The code iterates through the arrays using a `for` loop.
*   **`getOrDefault()`**: This HashMap method is used to either get the current count of a key or create a new entry if the key doesn't exist.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] findThePrefixCommonArray(int[] A, int[] B) {
        HashMap<Integer , Integer> val = new HashMap<>();
        int n = A.length;
        int[] C = new int[n];
        C[n-1] = n;
        for(int i = 0 ; i<n-1 ; i++) {
            val.put(A[i] , val.getOrDefault(A[i] , 0) + 1);
            val.put(B[i] , val.getOrDefault(B[i] , 0) + 1);
            int c = 0;
            for(int v : val.keySet()) {
                if(val.get(v) == 2) c++;
            }
            C[i] = c;
        }
        return C;
    }
}
```

1.  **`HashMap<Integer, Integer> val = new HashMap<>();`**:  A `HashMap` called `val` is created to store the frequency of each number seen so far.  The key is the number itself (an `Integer`), and the value is the count of how many times that number has appeared in either `A` or `B` up to the current index.

2.  **`int n = A.length;`**: Stores the length of the input array `A` (which is the same as `B`) in the variable `n`.

3.  **`int[] C = new int[n];`**:  Creates a new integer array `C` of size `n` to store the number of common elements for each prefix. This is the array we will return.

4.  **`C[n-1] = n;`**:  The last element of array 'C' is initialized with 'n'. This initialization is incorrect and unrelated to the problem's correct solution, it will lead to a wrong answer.

5.  **`for(int i = 0 ; i<n-1 ; i++) { ... }`**:  This loop iterates from `i = 0` to `n-2` (inclusive). This is where the prefix calculations happen.

6.  **`val.put(A[i] , val.getOrDefault(A[i] , 0) + 1);`**: This line updates the count of the element `A[i]` in the `val` hash map.  `val.getOrDefault(A[i], 0)` retrieves the current count of `A[i]` in the map. If `A[i]` is not already in the map, it returns 0. We then add 1 to the count and store it back in the map using `val.put(A[i], ...)`.

7.  **`val.put(B[i] , val.getOrDefault(B[i] , 0) + 1);`**:  This line does the same thing as the previous line, but for the element `B[i]`.

8.  **`int c = 0;`**:  Initializes a counter `c` to 0. This counter will store the number of common elements for the current prefix.

9.  **`for(int v : val.keySet()) { ... }`**: This enhanced `for` loop iterates through the keys (the numbers) in the `val` hash map.

10. **`if(val.get(v) == 2) c++;`**: Inside the inner loop, this `if` statement checks if the count of the current number `v` in the `val` hash map is equal to 2. If it is, it means that the number `v` has appeared once in the prefix of `A` and once in the prefix of `B`, so it's a common element. The counter `c` is incremented.

11. **`C[i] = c;`**:  After the inner loop finishes, the value of `c` (the number of common elements for the prefix `A[0...i]` and `B[0...i]`) is stored in `C[i]`.

12. **`return C;`**:  After the outer loop finishes, the array `C` is returned.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** The outer loop runs `n-1` times. The inner loop iterates through the keys of the hash map. In the worst-case scenario, all the elements of `A` and `B` up to a given index `i` are distinct, resulting in `2i` keys in the hash map. So, the inner loop takes `O(i)` time. Therefore, the overall time complexity is approximately O(n^2). The `put` and `getOrDefault` operations of the `HashMap` are, on average, O(1).

*   **Space Complexity:** The hash map `val` can store up to `2n` distinct elements in the worst case (when all elements in A and B are unique), so the space complexity is O(n). Additionally, the array `C` has a space complexity of O(n). Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(n).
