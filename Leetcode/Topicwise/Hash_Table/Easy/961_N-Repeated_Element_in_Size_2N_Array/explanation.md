### Problem Understanding

The problem "N-Repeated Element in Size 2N Array" presents us with an integer array `nums` of length `2N`. This array has a specific structure: it contains `N+1` unique elements in total. Among these `N+1` unique elements, exactly one element is repeated `N` times, while all other `N` elements appear exactly once. The task is to identify and return this single element that is repeated `N` times.

For example, if `nums = [1,2,3,3]`:
*   The length is `4`, so `2N = 4`, which means `N = 2`.
*   The problem states one element is repeated `N=2` times. Here,
