## Intersection of Two Linked Lists Problem Explanation

Here's a detailed explanation of the provided Java code for solving the "Intersection of Two Linked Lists" problem on LeetCode.

### 1. Problem Understanding

The problem asks us to find the intersection node of two singly linked lists, `headA` and `headB`.  The intersection is defined as the first node that is common to both lists.  If the lists don't intersect at all, we should return `null`.  It's important to note that we need to find the *node* itself, not just the value of the node. The prompt specifies that we should maintain O(1) memory.

### 2. Approach / Intuition

The core idea behind this solution is to cleverly handle the length differences between the two linked lists. If the lists are of different lengths, naively traversing them in parallel might miss the intersection point. This solution allows both pointers to traverse the entire concatenated length of *both* lists.

The approach leverages the following intuition:

1.  **Equalize Traversal Length:** The crucial insight is that if we can somehow make both pointers travel the same total distance, they will meet at the intersection point (if it exists).
2.  **Resetting Pointers:** We reset the `a` pointer to `headB` when it reaches the end of `headA`, and vice versa.  This essentially allows `a` to traverse `listA + listB`, and `b` to traverse `listB + listA`.
3.  **Meeting at Intersection (or Null):** If there's an intersection, the pointers `a` and `b` will eventually point to the same node (the intersection point) after traversing the concatenated paths. If there's no intersection, the pointers will both become `null` at the same time (after both have traversed the full concatenated path).

**Why this approach?** This approach is particularly elegant because it avoids the need to calculate the length of each list separately, which would introduce extra steps. Furthermore, it provides a O(1) space complexity solution as required by Leetcode.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms

*   **Data Structure:** Singly Linked List (implicitly defined by the `ListNode` class).
*   **Algorithm:** Two Pointers (or slow/fast pointer variant) - in this case, both pointers move at the same speed, but the trick is in their reset logic.

### 4. Code Walkthrough

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) {
 *         val = x;
 *         next = null;
 *     }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {
        ListNode a = headA;
        ListNode b = headB;

        while(a != b)
        {
            a = (a == null)?(headB):a.next;
            b = (b == null)?(headA):b.next;
        }

        return a;
    }
}
```

*   **`ListNode a = headA;`  `ListNode b = headB;`**: Initialize two pointers, `a` and `b`, to the heads of the two linked lists, `headA` and `headB`, respectively. These pointers will traverse the lists.

*   **`while(a != b)`**: This loop continues until the two pointers `a` and `b` point to the same node (or both become `null`).  This is the heart of the algorithm.

*   **`a = (a == null)?(headB):a.next;`**: This line is a concise way of expressing a conditional update of pointer `a`.
    *   If `a` is `null` (meaning it has reached the end of `headA`), then we reset it to `headB`. This starts `a` traversing `listB`.
    *   Otherwise (if `a` is not `null`), we move `a` to the next node in `headA` using `a.next`.

*   **`b = (b == null)?(headA):b.next;`**:  This line performs the same conditional update for pointer `b`, but with the roles of `headA` and `headB` reversed.  If `b` reaches the end of `headB`, it's reset to `headA`.

*   **`return a;`**: After the `while` loop terminates, the pointers `a` and `b` must either both point to the intersection node or both be `null` (if no intersection exists).  Therefore, we can simply return `a` (or `b`, since they are equal at this point). If there is no intersection, the loop ends when both `a` and `b` are `null`, returning `null`.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity

*   **Time Complexity:** O(m + n), where `m` is the length of `headA` and `n` is the length of `headB`. In the worst case (no intersection), each pointer will traverse both lists once.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1). The solution uses only a constant amount of extra space (two pointers, `a` and `b`), regardless of the input list sizes. This fulfills the requirements of the prompt, specifically the O(1) memory constraint.
