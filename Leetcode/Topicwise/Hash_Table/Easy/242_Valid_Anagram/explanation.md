## Valid Anagram - Problem Explanation and Solution

Here's a detailed explanation of the provided Java code for the LeetCode "Valid Anagram" problem:

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to determine if two given strings, `s` and `t`, are anagrams of each other.  Two strings are anagrams if they contain the same characters with the same frequencies, but in a different order.  For example, "anagram" and "nagaram" are anagrams, while "rat" and "car" are not.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is to count the frequency of each character in both strings. If the frequency counts are identical, then the strings are anagrams.  We can achieve this efficiently using a character frequency array.

Here's the thought process:

1.  **Length Check:**  If the strings have different lengths, they cannot be anagrams. This is a crucial optimization.
2.  **Frequency Counting:** We create an array (of size 26, assuming the input strings contain only lowercase English letters). We iterate through the first string `s`, incrementing the count in the array for each character. Simultaneously, we iterate through the second string `t` and decrement the count in the same array for each character.
3.  **Verification:** If the strings are anagrams, all the elements in the frequency array should be zero after processing both strings. We iterate through the array and check if any element is non-zero. If we find a non-zero element, it means that one string had more of a certain character than the other, so they are not anagrams.
4.  **Why this approach?** This approach is efficient because it involves a single pass through each string for frequency counting and a single pass through the frequency array for verification. It avoids sorting or other more complex operations.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structure:** An integer array `arr` of size 26 (representing the frequency count for each lowercase English letter). This acts as our character frequency map.
*   **Algorithm:** The core algorithm involves:
    *   **Iteration:** Iterating through the strings to update the character frequency array.
    *   **Array manipulation:** Incrementing and decrementing frequency counts in the array.
    *   **Linear Search:** Iterating through the array to verify if all frequencies are zero.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isAnagram(String s, String t) {
        if(s.length() == t.length())
        {
            int[] arr = new int[26];
            for(int i = 0 ; i < s.length() ; i++)
            {
                arr[s.charAt(i) - 97] +=1;
                arr[t.charAt(i) - 97] -=1;
            }
            for(int x : arr) if(x!=0) return false;
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

1.  **`class Solution { ... }`**: This defines a class named `Solution` that will contain our `isAnagram` method.
2.  **`public boolean isAnagram(String s, String t) { ... }`**: This declares the `isAnagram` method, which takes two strings, `s` and `t`, as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether they are anagrams.
3.  **`if(s.length() == t.length()) { ... }`**: This checks if the lengths of the two strings are equal. If they are not equal, the strings cannot be anagrams, so the method immediately returns `false`. This is a crucial optimization.
4.  **`int[] arr = new int[26];`**:  This creates an integer array `arr` of size 26. Each index in this array will store the frequency count of a lowercase English alphabet character ('a' to 'z').  `arr[0]` will store the frequency of 'a', `arr[1]` for 'b', and so on.
5.  **`for(int i = 0 ; i < s.length() ; i++) { ... }`**: This loop iterates through the characters of the strings `s` and `t` simultaneously.
6.  **`arr[s.charAt(i) - 97] += 1;`**:  Inside the loop, `s.charAt(i)` gets the character at the `i`-th position in string `s`. Then `s.charAt(i) - 97` calculates the index in the array.  Since 'a' has ASCII value 97, subtracting 97 from the ASCII value of any lowercase letter gives its index (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', and so on). The `+= 1` increments the count for that character in the `arr` array.
7.  **`arr[t.charAt(i) - 97] -= 1;`**: Similarly, `t.charAt(i)` gets the character at the `i`-th position in string `t`.  `t.charAt(i) - 97` calculates the index in the array. The `-= 1` decrements the count for that character in the `arr` array.  By incrementing the counts for characters in `s` and decrementing the counts for characters in `t`, we can determine if the character frequencies are the same.
8.  **`for(int x : arr) if(x!=0) return false;`**: This enhanced for loop iterates through each element `x` in the `arr` array.  If any element `x` is not equal to 0, it means the frequency of that corresponding character is different in `s` and `t`, so the method immediately returns `false`.
9.  **`return true;`**: If the loop completes without finding any non-zero elements in `arr`, it means the strings are anagrams, so the method returns `true`.
10. **`return false;`**:  If the initial length check fails (the strings have different lengths), the method returns `false`.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the strings `s` and `t`. The code iterates through the strings once to count character frequencies and then iterates through the frequency array (which has a fixed size of 26).  Since the size of the array is constant, the time complexity is dominated by the string iteration.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1). The space used by the `arr` array is constant (26 integers), regardless of the input string size. Thus the space complexity is considered constant.
