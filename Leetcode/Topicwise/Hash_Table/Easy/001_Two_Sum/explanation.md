## Two Sum Problem Explanation

Here's a detailed explanation of the provided Java code for the LeetCode "Two Sum" problem:

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The "Two Sum" problem asks us to find two distinct indices within an array of integers (`nums`) such that the sum of the elements at those indices equals a given target value (`target`). The problem guarantees that there will be exactly one solution.  We need to return an array containing the two indices that satisfy this condition.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The provided code utilizes a brute-force approach. The core idea is to iterate through all possible pairs of numbers in the input array and check if their sum equals the target.

*   **Brute-Force Iteration:** We systematically check every possible combination of two numbers to see if they add up to the target.  This guarantees that we'll find the solution (since the problem states there is exactly one).

The reason for choosing this approach (in this particular, potentially non-optimal implementation) is likely simplicity.  It's easy to understand and implement, though less efficient than other solutions.

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

*   **Data Structure:** The primary data structure is an integer array (`nums`).
*   **Algorithm:** The code uses nested loops to iterate through all possible pairs of elements within the array. This can be categorized as a brute-force or exhaustive search algorithm.

**4. Code Walkthrough:**

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        for(int i=1;i<nums.length;i++)
            for(int j=i;j<nums.length;j++)
                if(nums[j]+nums[j-i]==target)
                    return new int[] {j-i,j};
        return new int[] {};
    }
}
```

*   **`class Solution { ... }`:**  This defines a class named `Solution` that contains the `twoSum` method. This is standard practice in LeetCode solutions.
*   **`public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) { ... }`:** This is the method that takes the input array `nums` and the target value `target` as input. It is expected to return an integer array containing the indices of the two numbers that sum to the target.
*   **`for(int i=1; i < nums.length; i++)`:** This is the outer loop.  It iterates from `i = 1` up to `nums.length - 1`.  The code starts `i` from 1, instead of 0 as is more typical.
*   **`for(int j=i; j < nums.length; j++)`:** This is the inner loop.  It iterates from `j = i` up to `nums.length - 1`.  This avoids checking the same pair twice and also ensures that we are not comparing `nums[j]` to itself.
*   **`if(nums[j] + nums[j-i] == target)`:** This is the core logic.  It checks if the sum of the elements at indices `j` and `j-i` equals the `target`.  This is where the logic to search for the solution happens.
*   **`return new int[] {j-i, j};`:** If the sum equals the target, this line creates a new integer array containing the indices `j-i` and `j`, and returns it. This array represents the solution.
*   **`return new int[] {};`:** If the loops complete without finding a solution (which *shouldn't* happen according to the problem constraints, but it's good practice to include), an empty integer array is returned.

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

*   **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the length of the `nums` array. This is because the nested loops iterate through all possible pairs of elements. For each element, the code checks a conditional statement. The number of operations grows quadratically with the input size.
*   **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(1).  The code uses a fixed amount of extra space, regardless of the input size.  The extra space used is for the `i` and `j` loop variables and the array that is returned containing the result. The returned array contains at most two integers. There are no additional data structures that scale with the size of the input.

**Potential Improvements:**

The provided solution is a basic brute-force approach and not the most efficient.  A significantly better solution would use a hash map (dictionary) to reduce the time complexity to O(n).  Here's the basic idea:

1.  Iterate through the `nums` array.
2.  For each element `nums[i]`, calculate the `complement` needed to reach the target (i.e., `complement = target - nums[i]`).
3.  Check if the `complement` exists as a key in the hash map.
    *   If it does, we've found our solution! The current index `i` and the index associated with the `complement` in the hash map are the indices we're looking for.
    *   If it doesn't, add the current element `nums[i]` as a key to the hash map, with its index `i` as the value.

This hash map approach reduces the time complexity to O(n) because hash map lookups take, on average, constant time. The space complexity increases to O(n) in the worst case because the hash map could potentially store all the elements of the input array.
