## LeetCode Problem: Count Number of Maximum Bitwise-OR Subsets

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the number of subsets of a given integer array `nums` whose bitwise OR operation results in the maximum possible value among all subsets.  In other words, we need to count how many subsets achieve the largest possible bitwise OR value.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach with backtracking.  The core idea is to explore all possible subsets of the input array. For each element, we have two choices: either include it in the current subset or exclude it.  We recursively explore both possibilities.

We first calculate the maximum possible bitwise OR value (`max`) by performing a bitwise OR operation on all elements of the input array. This provides an upper bound for the OR value of any subset. Then, the `dfs` function recursively explores all subsets.  It keeps track of the current bitwise OR value (`orval`). If, at the end of exploring a subset, the `orval` is equal to `max`, we increment the count (`ans`).

This approach is chosen because it systematically explores the entire search space of subsets, ensuring that no subset with the maximum bitwise OR is missed.  Other approaches like iterative subset generation would be less efficient for larger input arrays.

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:** The primary data structure used is the input array `nums` itself.  No other significant data structures are employed.
* **Algorithms:** The core algorithm is Depth-First Search (DFS) with backtracking.  Bitwise OR operations (`|`) are also heavily used.

**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **`max = 0; ans = 0;`**: Initializes two instance variables. `max` stores the maximum possible bitwise OR value, and `ans` counts the number of subsets achieving this maximum.
* **`private void dfs(int[] nums, int i, int orval)`**: This recursive function performs the DFS.
    * **`if(i == nums.length)`**: Base case: If we've processed all elements, check if the current `orval` equals `max`. If so, increment `ans`.
    * **`dfs(nums, i+1, orval | nums[i]);`**: Recursive call to include the current element (`nums[i]`) in the subset.  The bitwise OR operation updates `orval`.
    * **`dfs(nums, i+1, orval);`**: Recursive call to exclude the current element. `orval` remains unchanged.
* **`public int countMaxOrSubsets(int[] nums)`**: This is the main function.
    * **`for(int v : nums) max |= v;`**: Calculates the maximum possible bitwise OR value by ORing all elements together.
    * **`dfs(nums, 0, 0);`**: Initiates the DFS starting from index 0 with an initial `orval` of 0.
    * **`return ans;`**: Returns the final count of subsets with the maximum bitwise OR value.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(2<sup>n</sup>), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because the DFS explores all possible subsets, and the number of subsets is 2<sup>n</sup>.  Each subset calculation involves a constant number of bitwise OR operations.
* **Space Complexity:** O(n). The space complexity is dominated by the recursive call stack in the DFS. In the worst case, the depth of the recursion is n, representing the length of the input array.  The auxiliary space used is proportional to the recursion depth.  We are not using any additional data structures that scale with the input size besides the recursion stack.


In summary, this solution efficiently solves the problem by using a depth-first search to explore all subsets and count those with the maximum bitwise OR value.  While the time complexity is exponential, it's the most straightforward and efficient approach for this specific problem.
