## LeetCode: Combinations - Detailed Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find all possible combinations of *k* numbers chosen from the range 1 to *n*.  For example, if `n = 4` and `k = 2`, the output should be all possible pairs of numbers from {1, 2, 3, 4}:  [[1,2], [1,3], [1,4], [2,3], [2,4], [3,4]].


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution uses a recursive backtracking approach.  This is a natural fit for this problem because we need to explore all possible combinations systematically.  The core idea is:

* **Base Cases:**
    * If we've already selected `k` numbers (`list.size() == k`), we've found a valid combination, so we add it to the `ans` list and return.
    * If `cur` (the current number we are considering) is less than 1, we've exhausted all possibilities at this level of recursion, so we return.

* **Recursive Step:**
    * We recursively explore two possibilities for each number `cur`:
        * **Exclude `cur`:** We call `comb(cur-1, k, list)` to explore combinations without including `cur`.
        * **Include `cur`:** We add `cur` to the `list`, then recursively call `comb(cur-1, k, list)` to explore combinations that include `cur`.  After this recursive call, we remove `cur` from the `list` (backtracking) to explore other possibilities.  This ensures that we explore all combinations without duplicates.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * `List<List<Integer>> ans`: A list of lists of integers to store all the combinations.
    * `List<Integer> list`: A list of integers to keep track of the current combination being built during recursion.
* **Algorithms:**
    * **Backtracking:** The core algorithm used to explore all possible combinations systematically.  It involves exploring a choice, recursively exploring subsequent choices, and then backtracking (undoing the choice) to explore alternative paths.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **`List<List<Integer>> ans = new ArrayList<>();`**:  Initializes a list to store the final result (all combinations).

* **`private void comb(int cur, int k, List<Integer> list)`**: This is the recursive helper function.
    * `if(list.size() == k)`: Base case 1: If we've selected `k` numbers, add a copy of the current `list` to `ans` and return.  We create a copy using `new ArrayList<>(list)` to avoid modifying the `list` used in other recursive calls.
    * `if(cur < 1)`: Base case 2: If `cur` is less than 1, we've exhausted all numbers, so we return.
    * `comb(cur-1, k, list)`: Explore combinations excluding the current number.
    * `list.add(cur)`: Include the current number in the combination.
    * `comb(cur-1, k, list)`: Recursively explore combinations including the current number.
    * `list.remove(list.size() - 1)`: Backtrack: Remove the current number from the list after exploring combinations with it.

* **`public List<List<Integer>> combine(int n, int k)`**: This is the main function.
    * `comb(n, k, new ArrayList<>())`: Initiates the recursive process by calling `comb` with the initial values: `n` (largest number), `k` (number of elements per combination), and an empty list.
    * `return ans`: Returns the list containing all the generated combinations.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(n! / (k! * (n-k)!)). This represents the total number of combinations, which is the number of times the base case is hit.  The recursive calls explore all possible combinations.

* **Space Complexity:** O(k * C(n,k))  The space complexity is dominated by the space needed to store all the generated combinations.  Each combination has size `k`, and the number of combinations is C(n,k) (n choose k).  The recursion depth is O(k), contributing to the space used on the call stack.  Note that  O(k * C(n,k))  is also expressible as O(n * C(n, k)) for k < n/2 as k is then less than n -k, and as O((n-k) * C(n, k)) for k > n/2. Therefore a more accurate upperbound would be O(max(k, n-k) * C(n,k)).  However, if we consider C(n, k) as the dominant factor, the expression can be simplified to O(n * C(n, k)).


In summary, this solution efficiently generates all combinations using backtracking, with a time complexity directly proportional to the number of combinations and a space complexity determined by the storage of the results.  The use of backtracking is crucial for exploring all possibilities without redundant calculations.
