## Final Value of Variable After Performing Operations - Detailed Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to determine the final value of a variable `x` after performing a series of increment or decrement operations.  `x` starts at 0.  The operations are given as a string array `operations`, where each string represents a single operation. The operations can be either incrementing (`++X` or `X++`) or decrementing (`--X` or `X--`). The order in which the operations are performed matters. We need to simulate these operations and return the final value of `x`.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is straightforward: initialize a variable `x` to 0 and iterate through the `operations` array. For each operation, check if it's an increment or decrement operation.  If it's an increment, increment `x`; otherwise, decrement `x`.  Finally, return the value of `x`.  This approach is chosen because it directly simulates the problem's description. There's no need for complex data structures or algorithms; a simple loop and conditional statements are sufficient.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:** No complex data structures are used.  We primarily deal with primitive types (int) and String arrays.
*   **Algorithms:**  The solution uses a simple **linear iteration (loop)** through the `operations` array.  Inside the loop, there are **conditional statements (if-else)** to determine whether to increment or decrement the variable `x`.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int finalValueAfterOperations(String[] operations) {
        int x = 0; // Initialize the variable x to 0.  This is the starting value as stated in the problem.

        for(String s : operations) { // Iterate through each string 's' in the 'operations' array.
            if(s.equals("X++") || s.equals("++X")) x++; // Check if the string 's' is equal to "X++" OR "++X".  If it is, increment the value of x by 1.
            else x--; // If the string 's' is not an increment operation (i.e., it's "--X" or "X--"), decrement the value of x by 1.
        }

        return x; // After iterating through all the operations, return the final value of x.
    }
}
```

*   **`int x = 0;`**: This line initializes an integer variable `x` to 0. This variable will store the final value we need to return.
*   **`for(String s : operations)`**: This is a `for-each` loop that iterates through each string element in the `operations` array.  In each iteration, the current string is assigned to the variable `s`.
*   **`if(s.equals("X++") || s.equals("++X")) x++;`**: This `if` statement checks if the current string `s` is equal to "X++" or "++X". The `equals()` method is used for String comparison.  If either of these conditions is true, it means the operation is an increment, so we increment `x` by 1 using the post-increment operator `x++`.
*   **`else x--;`**: If the `if` condition is false, it implies the operation is a decrement (either "--X" or "X--").  Therefore, we decrement `x` by 1 using the post-decrement operator `x--`. The problem description guarantees that the input will only have these four types of operations.
*   **`return x;`**: After the loop has finished iterating through all the operations, this line returns the final value of `x`.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of operations in the `operations` array. This is because the code iterates through the array once. The operations inside the loop (string comparison and increment/decrement) take constant time.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1).  The solution uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the size of the input array.  We only use a single integer variable `x`.  The `operations` array is already present in the input and doesn't contribute to auxiliary space complexity.
