## LeetCode Problem: Divide a String Into Groups of Size k - Solution Explained

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to divide a given string `s` into groups of size `k`. If the length of the string is not a multiple of `k`, we need to pad the string with a specified character `fill` until its length becomes a multiple of `k`.  The solution should return an array of strings, where each string represents a group of size `k`.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution employs a straightforward approach:

1. **Padding:** First, it checks if the length of the input string `s` is divisible by `k`. If not, it appends the `fill` character to the end of the string until the length becomes a multiple of `k`.  This ensures we can evenly divide the string into groups.

2. **Grouping:**  Next, it iterates through the padded string with a step size of `k`. In each iteration, it extracts a substring of length `k` using `substring()` and adds it to the `ans` array. The index calculation `i/k` ensures that each substring is placed correctly in the `ans` array.

This approach was chosen due to its simplicity and efficiency. It directly addresses the problem requirements with minimal complexity.  More sophisticated algorithms are not necessary for this problem.

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:** The primary data structure used is a `StringBuilder` to efficiently manipulate the string by appending the fill character. An array of strings (`String[]`) is used to store the resulting groups.

* **Algorithms:** The core algorithm is a simple iterative approach with a linear time complexity.  No advanced algorithms like dynamic programming or graph traversal are needed.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

```java
class Solution {
    public String[] divideString(String s, int k, char fill) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(s); // Create a StringBuilder from the input string. This allows efficient modification.
        while(sb.length() % k != 0) sb.append(fill); // Pad the string until length is a multiple of k.
        String[] ans = new String[sb.length()/k]; // Create an array to store the resulting groups.  The size is determined by the padded string length / k.
        String ss = sb.toString(); // Convert the StringBuilder back to a String for easier substring extraction.
        for(int i = 0 ; i < ss.length() ; i+=k) { // Iterate through the string with a step of k.
            ans[i/k] = ss.substring(i , i+k); // Extract a substring of length k and add it to the ans array.  i/k ensures correct indexing.
        }
        return ans; // Return the array of strings.
    }
}
```


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`. The padding operation takes O(n) in the worst case (when significant padding is needed), and the iteration and substring extraction also take O(n) time.

* **Space Complexity:** O(n). The `StringBuilder` uses O(n) space in the worst case (if significant padding is needed). The `ans` array also uses O(n) space to store the resulting groups.  The space used is directly proportional to the length of the input string after padding.
