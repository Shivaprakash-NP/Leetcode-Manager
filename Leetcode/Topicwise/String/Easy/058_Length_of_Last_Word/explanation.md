## Length of Last Word - LeetCode Problem Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to find the length of the last word in a given string. A word is defined as a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only. The string `s` might contain leading or trailing spaces, or multiple spaces between words. If there is no last word (e.g., the string is empty or consists only of spaces), the problem implicitly suggests returning 0 or handling the potential `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` (although the test cases ensure there is at least one word).

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The most straightforward approach is to first split the string into an array of words using the space character as a delimiter. Then, we can access the last element of this array (which corresponds to the last word) and return its length.  The primary reason for choosing this approach is its simplicity and ease of understanding. Although other approaches exist, such as iterating from the end of the string, splitting is often easier to reason about.

However, there's a potential issue with trailing spaces.  The `split()` method might create empty strings at the end of the `val` array if the input string ends with spaces. This leads to `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` and incorrect results. To avoid that, we should handle the edge case where the array contains empty strings or is empty altogether. We can do this by either filtering out the empty strings from the array or trimming the input string.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structure:** An array of strings (`String[]`) is used to store the individual words after splitting the input string.
*   **Algorithm:** The core algorithm is string splitting, facilitated by the `String.split()` method. Implicitly, there's also array access to retrieve the last element.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLastWord(String s) {
        String[] val = s.split(" ");
        // The following line is vulnerable to errors. 
        // It will throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if the input string ends with spaces
        // because val will contain empty strings as the last elements.
        return val[val.length-1].length();
    }
}
```

1.  **`class Solution { ... }`:**  Defines the class containing the solution method.
2.  **`public int lengthOfLastWord(String s) { ... }`:**  This is the main method that takes a string `s` as input and returns an integer representing the length of the last word.
3.  **`String[] val = s.split(" ");`:** This line uses the `split()` method to divide the input string `s` into an array of substrings (words). The delimiter used for splitting is a single space `" "`. The resulting array `val` contains all the words from the input string.
4.  **`return val[val.length-1].length();`:** This line calculates and returns the length of the last word. `val.length - 1` accesses the index of the last element in the `val` array. Then `.length()` is called on that last string to determine its length, which is then returned.

**Important Note about Potential Errors:** The original solution is vulnerable to `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  Consider the input string `"   fly me   to   the moon  "`. The `split(" ")` would produce an array like `["", "", "", "fly", "me", "", "", "to", "", "", "the", "moon", "", ""]`.  Attempting to access `val[val.length-1]` would access the last empty string element, and `.length()` would still work in this case. However, an input string of `"   "` would produce an array of `["", "", ""]` and the logic *would* work but return zero. An empty string would cause an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. A more robust solution should handle these cases by trimming the string first.

Here's a more robust corrected version:

```java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLastWord(String s) {
        s = s.trim(); // Remove leading and trailing spaces
        if (s.isEmpty()) {
            return 0;
        }
        String[] val = s.split(" ");
        return val[val.length - 1].length();
    }
}
```

1. **`s = s.trim();`**: This line removes leading and trailing whitespace from the input string `s`.  This is crucial for handling cases where the string might start or end with spaces, which would otherwise lead to incorrect results after the `split()` operation.

2. **`if (s.isEmpty()) { return 0; }`**: Checks if the trimmed string is empty. If so, it means the original string contained only whitespace or was empty, so we return 0 as the length of the last word.

With these changes, the solution is more robust and handles various edge cases correctly.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`.
    *   `trim()` in the corrected solution takes O(n) time in the worst case (if there are lots of leading/trailing spaces).
    *   `split()` also takes O(n) time in the worst case, as it potentially needs to iterate through the entire string.
    *   Accessing `val[val.length - 1]` and calculating `.length()` takes O(1) time.
    *   The corrected version's `isEmpty()` check takes O(1).

*   **Space Complexity:** O(n) in the worst case.
    *   The `split()` method creates a new array `val` which, in the worst case (e.g., when the string consists of words separated by single spaces), can have the same length as the original string.
    * The `trim()` method may or may not create a new string depending on whether there are leading/trailing spaces.

Therefore, the overall time and space complexities are dominated by the string splitting operation.
