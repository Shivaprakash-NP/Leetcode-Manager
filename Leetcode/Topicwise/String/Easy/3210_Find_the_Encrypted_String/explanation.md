### Problem Understanding

The problem asks us to "encrypt" a given string `s` by shifting its characters. The encryption rule is a cyclic shift: the first `k` characters of the string are moved to the end of the string, while the remaining characters shift to the beginning. This effectively rotates the string to the left by `k` positions. The shift `k` can be any non-negative integer, potentially larger than the string's length.

For example, if `s = "abcdef"` and `k = 2`, the first two characters (`ab`) move to the end, resulting in `"cdefab"`. If `k` is equal to the string's length, or a multiple of it, the string should remain unchanged (e.g., `k=6` for `"abcdef"` results in `"abcdef"`).

### Approach / Intuition

The core idea is string rotation. If we need to shift the string `s` to the left by `k` positions, it means the characters from index `k` to the end of the string will form the new beginning, and the characters from index `0` to `k-1` will form the new end.

Let's break down the intuition:

1.  **Handle `k` exceeding string length:** A shift of `k` positions is equivalent to a shift of `k % n` positions, where `n` is the length of the string. For instance, shifting a 5-character string by 7 positions is the same as shifting it by `7 % 5 = 2` positions. This is crucial for cyclic behavior.
2.  **Divide and Concatenate:** Once `k` is normalized (i.e., `0 <= k < n`), we can conceptually divide the string `s` into two parts:
    *   Part 1: `s[k ... n-1]` (from index `k` to the end)
    *   Part 2: `s[0 ... k-1]` (from index `0` up to, but not including, `k`)
    The encrypted string is simply Part 1 concatenated with Part 2.

This approach is chosen because it directly implements the definition of a left cyclic shift using standard string manipulation operations available in most programming languages. It's concise and efficient for this specific type of rotation.

### Data Structures and Algorithms

*   **Data Structure:**
    *   `String`: The input and output are standard immutable `String` objects in Java.
*   **Algorithms:**
    *   **Modulo Operator (`%`):** Used to normalize the shift value `k` to ensure it's within the bounds of the string length, handling cyclic shifts correctly.
    *   **Substring Extraction (`substring()`):** A built-in string method used to extract portions of the original string.
    *   **String Concatenation (`+` operator):** Used to join the two extracted substrings to form the final encrypted string.

### Code Walkthrough

```java
class Solution {
    public String getEncryptedString(String s, int k) {
        // 1. Get the length of the input string.
        int n = s.length();

        // 2. Normalize k using the modulo operator.
        // This ensures k is always between 0 and n-1 (inclusive).
        // If k is n, it becomes 0 (a full rotation is no change).
        // If k is greater than n, it wraps around.
        // If k is 0, it remains 0.
        k %= n;

        // 3. Construct and return the encrypted string.
        // s.substring(k) extracts the part of the string starting from index k
        // up to the end (s[k], s[k+1], ..., s[n-1]). This forms the new beginning.
        // s.substring(0, k) extracts the part of the string starting from index 0
        // up to (but not including) index k (s[0], s[1], ..., s[k-1]). This forms the new end.
        // The '+' operator concatenates these two parts.
        return s.substring(k) + s.substring(0, k);
    }
}
```

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1.  `int n = s.length();`: This line gets the total number of characters in the input string `s` and stores it in the integer variable `n`.
2.  `k %= n;`: This is a crucial step for handling cyclic shifts.
    *   If `k` is less than `n`, `k` remains unchanged.
    *   If `k` is equal to `n`, `k` becomes `0` (a full rotation means no effective change).
    *   If `k` is greater than `n`, `k` becomes the remainder of `k` divided by `n`. This effectively finds the equivalent minimal positive shift. For example, if `s` has length 5 and `k` is 7, `k` becomes `7 % 5 = 2`.
    This ensures that `k` is always in the range `[0, n-1]`, representing the effective left shift.
3.  `return s.substring(k) + s.substring(0, k);`: This line performs the actual encryption.
    *   `s.substring(k)`: This method call creates a new string containing characters from the original string `s` starting at index `k` and going all the way to the end of `s`. This will be the first part of our encrypted string.
    *   `s.substring(0, k)`: This method call creates another new string containing characters from `s` starting at index `0` and going up to (but not including) index `k`. This will be the second part of our encrypted string.
    *   The `+` operator then concatenates these two new strings. The result is the original string `s` rotated left by `k` positions.

### Time and Space Complexity

*   **Time Complexity: O(N)**
    *   `s.length()`: O(1) as string length is typically stored.
    *   `k %= n`: O(1) for a simple arithmetic operation.
    *   `s.substring(k)`: In Java, `substring` creates a new `String` object and copies the relevant characters. If the substring has length `L`, this operation takes O(L) time. Here, it creates a substring of length `n-k`, so it's O(n-k).
    *   `s.substring(0, k)`: Similarly, this creates a substring of length `k`, taking O(k) time.
    *   `+` (String concatenation): When using the `+` operator for strings in Java, it's typically optimized by the compiler to use a `StringBuilder`. This involves appending the two substrings and then converting the `StringBuilder` back to a `String`. This process involves copying all characters of the resulting string, which has length `n`. Thus, concatenation takes O(n) time.
    *   Overall, the dominant operations are the `substring` calls and the final concatenation, all of which are proportional to the length of the string `n`. Therefore, the total time complexity is O(N).

*   **Space Complexity: O(N)**
    *   `s.substring(k)`: Creates a new string of length `n-k`, requiring O(n-k) space.
    *   `s.substring(0, k)`: Creates another new string of length `k`, requiring O(k) space.
    *   The final concatenated string: Creates a third new string of length `n`, requiring O(n) space.
    *   Since new strings are created whose total length is proportional to the input string's length, the space complexity is O(N).
