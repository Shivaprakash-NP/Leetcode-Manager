## Remove Outermost Parentheses Problem Explanation

This document provides a detailed explanation of the Java code solution for the LeetCode problem "Remove Outermost Parentheses."

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to take a string of balanced parentheses (a string where each opening parenthesis has a matching closing parenthesis), and decompose it into its *primitive* components.  A primitive string is a balanced string that cannot be further decomposed into smaller balanced strings. The goal is to remove the outermost parentheses of each primitive string and concatenate the results.  For example, the string "(()())(())" can be decomposed into "(()())" and "(())". Removing the outermost parentheses from each gives "()()" and "()", respectively.  Concatenating those produces the final answer: "()()()".

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is to maintain a counter `m` that tracks the balance of parentheses encountered so far. We iterate through the string character by character. The `m` variable indicates the nesting level.  We only append a parenthesis to the result if it is *not* an outermost parenthesis.

*   **Opening Parenthesis `(`:**  If we encounter an opening parenthesis, we increment `m`. We only append it to the result *if* `m` is already greater than 0 *before* the increment.  This means we're inside a primitive component and not at the outermost level.

*   **Closing Parenthesis `)`:** If we encounter a closing parenthesis, we decrement `m`. We only append it to the result *if* `m` is greater than 0 *after* the decrement.  This means we're inside a primitive component and not at the outermost level.

The intuition behind this approach is that `m` effectively tracks the nesting depth of the parentheses.  When `m` is 0, we are outside any primitive string.  When `m` becomes 1, we've entered a new primitive string. Only when `m` > 0, inside the `if` statement, do we add the character to our string builder. This ensures that the outermost parentheses of each primitive string are excluded.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **StringBuilder:** Used to efficiently construct the output string by appending characters incrementally.  String concatenation using `+` repeatedly can be inefficient, especially for long strings, because it creates new String objects in each concatenation.
*   **Integer Counter:** The integer variable `m` acts as a stack implicitly, maintaining the nesting level. It's the key algorithm.
*   **Iteration:** The solution iterates through the input string character by character. This is a fundamental algorithmic technique.
*   **Conditional Logic:** The `if` statements determine whether to append a parenthesis to the result, based on the current nesting level.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public String removeOuterParentheses(String s) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(); // Create a StringBuilder to store the result.

        int m = 0; // Initialize a counter to track parenthesis balance/nesting depth.

        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) // Iterate through each character in the input string.
        {
            if (c == ')') m--; // Decrement the counter if we encounter a closing parenthesis. This happens *before* checking if we should append it.

            if (m > 0) sb.append(c); // Append the character to the StringBuilder if the counter is greater than 0 (not outermost).

            if (c == '(') m++; // Increment the counter if we encounter an opening parenthesis. This happens *after* checking if we should append it.
        }

        return sb.toString(); // Convert the StringBuilder to a String and return it.
    }
}
```

*   **`StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();`:** Creates a `StringBuilder` object named `sb` to efficiently build the result string.

*   **`int m = 0;`:** Initializes an integer variable `m` to 0.  This variable will track the nesting level of the parentheses.

*   **`for (char c : s.toCharArray())`:** This loop iterates through each character `c` in the input string `s`.  `s.toCharArray()` converts the string into an array of characters, which is then iterated over.

*   **`if (c == ')') m--;`:** If the current character is a closing parenthesis `)`, the counter `m` is decremented.  This signifies that we are moving one level outwards in the nesting of parentheses. It's crucial to decrement *before* checking if we need to append.

*   **`if (m > 0) sb.append(c);`:** This is the key part of the logic.  If `m` is greater than 0, it means that the current parenthesis is *not* an outermost parenthesis, so we append it to the `StringBuilder`.

*   **`if (c == '(') m++;`:** If the current character is an opening parenthesis `(`, the counter `m` is incremented. This signifies that we are moving one level deeper into the nesting of parentheses. Crucially, we increment *after* checking if we need to append the `(`.

*   **`return sb.toString();`:** After the loop finishes, the `StringBuilder` `sb` contains the string with the outermost parentheses removed. This line converts the `StringBuilder` to a regular `String` and returns it.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`. The code iterates through the string once.  Each operation inside the loop (character comparison, counter increment/decrement, `StringBuilder.append()`) takes constant time.

*   **Space Complexity:** O(n) in the worst case, where n is the length of the input string. This is because, in the worst-case scenario (e.g., "(()(()))"), the `StringBuilder` could potentially store a string that is only slightly smaller than the original input string (after removing the outermost parentheses). Although the `m` variable only requires O(1) space, the StringBuilder potentially depends on the size of `n`.
