## Valid Palindrome II - Problem Explanation and Solution

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem "Valid Palindrome II" asks us to determine if a given string `s` can become a palindrome after deleting *at most one* character.  In other words, we need to check if the string is already a palindrome, or if removing a single character can make it a palindrome.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is to use a two-pointer approach. We start with pointers at the beginning and end of the string.  If the characters at the pointers match, we move both pointers towards the center. If we encounter a mismatch, it means that either the character at the left pointer or the character at the right pointer needs to be removed to potentially form a palindrome.  Therefore, we recursively check if the string is a palindrome after removing the left character and after removing the right character. If either of these removals results in a palindrome, we return `true`. If we reach the center of the string without any mismatches, the string is already a palindrome, and we return `true`.

This approach is chosen because it efficiently checks the palindrome property and handles the "one character deletion" constraint without requiring extensive string manipulation or creating many substrings. The two-pointer technique is well-suited for palindrome problems.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:**  Primarily we are using the input string `s`, which is the core data structure. We're also implicitly using the call stack for the recursive `is` function.
*   **Algorithms:**
    *   **Two-Pointer Technique:**  Used to efficiently compare characters from both ends of the string.
    *   **Recursion:** Used to explore the two possible scenarios when a mismatch is encountered: removing the left character or removing the right character. Although recursion is used, it's crucial to note this approach doesn't need excessive recursion depth, as it only goes one level deep.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    private boolean is(String s , int l , int r) {
        while(l<r) {
            if(s.charAt(l) == s.charAt(r)) {
                l++;
                r--;
            } else return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
    
    public boolean validPalindrome(String s) {
        int l = 0;
        int r = s.length()-1;
        boolean alr = false;
        while(l<=r) {
            if(s.charAt(l) == s.charAt(r)) {
                l++;
                r--;
            } else {
                return is(s , l+1 , r) || is(s , l , r-1);
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

*   **`is(String s, int l, int r)` function:**
    *   This is a helper function that checks if the substring of `s` from index `l` to index `r` (inclusive) is a palindrome.
    *   It uses a `while` loop with two pointers, `l` and `r`, starting at the given indices.
    *   Inside the loop, it compares the characters at `s.charAt(l)` and `s.charAt(r)`.
    *   If the characters match, the pointers are moved towards the center: `l++` and `r--`.
    *   If the characters don't match, it immediately returns `false` because the substring is not a palindrome.
    *   If the loop completes without finding any mismatches (i.e., `l` becomes greater than or equal to `r`), it means the substring is a palindrome, and it returns `true`.

*   **`validPalindrome(String s)` function:**
    *   It initializes two pointers, `l` and `r`, to the start and end of the string `s`, respectively.
    *   It uses a `while` loop to iterate as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`.
    *   Inside the loop, it checks if the characters at `s.charAt(l)` and `s.charAt(r)` are equal.
    *   If they are equal, it moves the pointers towards the center: `l++` and `r--`.
    *   If they are not equal, it means we've found a potential mismatch that needs to be resolved by removing one character.
    *   It calls the `is` helper function twice:
        *   `is(s, l + 1, r)`: Checks if the string is a palindrome after removing the character at index `l`.
        *   `is(s, l, r - 1)`: Checks if the string is a palindrome after removing the character at index `r`.
    *   It returns `true` if either of these removals results in a palindrome (using the `||` operator). This is the "at most one deletion" condition.
    *   If the loop completes without finding any mismatches, it means the original string `s` is already a palindrome, and it returns `true`.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`.
    *   The `validPalindrome` function iterates through the string at most once using two pointers, giving O(n).
    *   In the worst case (when a mismatch is found), the `is` function is called twice.  Each call to `is` can also iterate through at most n characters in the string, giving O(n).
    *   Since the `is` function is called at most twice within the main loop, the overall time complexity remains O(n) + O(n) + O(n)  which simplifies to O(n).

*   **Space Complexity:** O(1) - Constant Space
    *   The solution uses only a few extra variables (pointers `l`, `r`, and potentially the stack for the recursive calls which is limited to one level of recursion), so the space complexity is constant, O(1). The recursion only adds a small constant overhead to the stack.  It does not depend on the length of the input string in a way that is considered non-constant.
