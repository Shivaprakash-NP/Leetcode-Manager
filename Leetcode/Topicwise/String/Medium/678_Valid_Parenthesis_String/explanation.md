## LeetCode: Valid Parenthesis String - Detailed Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem "Valid Parenthesis String" asks whether a given string containing '(', ')', and '*' characters is a valid parenthesis string.  A valid string follows these rules:

*   '(' and ')' must form valid pairs.
*   '*' can act as '(' , ')' or an empty string.

The goal is to determine if the input string can be made valid by interpreting '*' characters appropriately.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution employs a clever two-pointer approach using `l` (lower bound) and `h` (upper bound).  This approach efficiently tracks the minimum and maximum possible number of open parentheses at each position in the string.

*   `l` represents the minimum number of open parentheses needed to make the string valid up to the current position. If `l` becomes negative, it means we have more closing parentheses than opening ones, making the string invalid.

*   `h` represents the maximum number of open parentheses possible up to the current position, considering '*' as '(' when needed. If `h` becomes negative, it implies that even with maximum '*' interpretations, we've violated parenthesis balance.


The algorithm iterates through the string:

*   For '(':  increment both `l` and `h`.
*   For ')': decrement `h`. If `l` > 0, decrement `l` to consume an opening parenthesis; otherwise, set `l` to 0 (it's not possible to satisfy the minimum parentheses).
*   For '*': decrement `l` (if possible), but increment `h` to represent the maximum potential.


Finally, the string is valid if and only if `l` is 0 after processing the entire string (all opening parentheses have been matched).  The `h<0` check ensures that the parenthesis balance doesn't become negative at any point.


This approach is chosen because it avoids the explicit enumeration of all possible '*' interpretations, which would lead to exponential time complexity. By tracking minimum and maximum balances efficiently, it achieves linear time complexity.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

*   **Data Structures:**  The solution only uses primitive integer variables (`l` and `h`) to track the minimum and maximum open parentheses count.  No complex data structures are needed.
*   **Algorithms:** The core algorithm is a linear scan of the input string, combined with simple arithmetic operations (increment, decrement, and `Math.max`).


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean checkValidString(String s) {
        int l = 0 , h = 0; // Initialize lower and upper bounds

        for(char c : s.toCharArray()) { // Iterate through each character
            if(c == '(') {l++;h++;} // '(' increases both bounds
            if(c == ')') {l = Math.max(0 , l-1) ; h--;} // ')' decreases upper bound; adjusts lower bound to stay non-negative
            if(c == '*') {l = Math.max(0 , l-1) ; h++;} // '*' decreases lower bound (if possible), increases upper bound
            if(h<0) return false; // If upper bound is negative, it's impossible to make the string valid
        }

        return l==0; // The string is valid if and only if the lower bound is 0 at the end
    }
}
```

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input string. The code iterates through the string once.  All operations within the loop are constant time.

*   **Space Complexity:** O(1). The solution uses only a constant amount of extra space to store the variables `l` and `h`.  The space used is independent of the input string's size.

The efficiency of this linear time and constant space solution makes it optimal for the "Valid Parenthesis String" problem.
