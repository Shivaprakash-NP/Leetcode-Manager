## LeetCode: Accounts Merge Explained

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem "Accounts Merge" asks us to consolidate a list of email accounts.  Each account is represented as a list of strings, where the first string is the account name, and the rest are email addresses associated with that account.  Multiple accounts might share the same email addresses. The goal is to merge accounts with shared emails, resulting in a list where each account contains a unique set of emails, sorted alphabetically, along with the account name.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution uses a disjoint-set union (DSU) data structure to efficiently merge accounts sharing emails.  The core idea is as follows:

* **Represent Accounts as Nodes:** Each account is treated as a node in a graph.
* **Emails as Edges:**  If two accounts share an email, we consider that an edge connecting their corresponding nodes.
* **Union-Find:** The DSU algorithm's `union` function merges connected components (accounts with shared emails). The `find` function determines which component an account belongs to.
* **Consolidation:** After merging, we iterate through each component, gathering its emails and sorting them before appending them to the account name.


This approach is chosen because DSU provides a highly efficient way (nearly linear time) to find connected components in a graph, ideal for merging accounts based on shared email addresses.  Other approaches, like iterative merging without a DSU, would be significantly less efficient for large input sizes.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Disjoint-Set Union (DSU):**  Used to efficiently merge accounts with shared email addresses.  This is implemented using the `par` (parent) and `size` arrays.
* **HashMap (`map`):**  Used to map email addresses to their corresponding account indices for quick lookup during the union-find process.
* **HashMap (`val`):**  Used to store merged accounts, mapping the root account index (from DSU) to its list of emails.
* **ArrayList:** Used to store lists of email addresses for each account.
* **Collections.sort:** Used to sort the list of emails for each account.

**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **Initialization:**
    * `par` and `size` arrays are initialized for the DSU. `par[i] = i` means each account initially forms its own set. `size[i] = 1` represents the size of each set (initially 1 account).

* **Building the Union-Find Structure:**
    * The code iterates through each account and its emails.
    * For each email, it checks if the email exists in the `map`.
    * If it exists, it means we've encountered this email before, so we `union` the current account with the account associated with that email.
    * If it doesn't exist, it's a new email, and we add it to the `map` along with the current account's index.

* **Merging Accounts:**
    * The `find` function is the core of the DSU; it finds the root (representative) node of a set using path compression for efficiency.
    * The `union` function merges two sets by connecting their roots using union by rank (size in this case) for better efficiency.  There's a slight error in the code; it should be `par[a] = b` or `par[b] = a`, not both.

* **Collecting Merged Emails:**
    * `val` HashMap stores merged email accounts.  It maps the root index (from DSU `find`) to the list of emails belonging to that merged account.

* **Final Output Formatting:**
    * The code iterates through the `val` HashMap.
    * For each root index, it retrieves the account name from the original `accounts` list.
    * It retrieves the emails, sorts them, and adds them to a list along with the account name.
    * This list is then added to the `ans` list, which is finally returned.

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:**  O(N log N + M log M), where N is the number of accounts and M is the total number of emails. This is dominated by sorting the emails for each account (M log M) and the union-find operations, which are effectively amortized O(N + M) due to path compression and union by rank, but including the HashMap operations.


* **Space Complexity:** O(N + M).  The space is mainly used by the `par`, `size` arrays (size N), the `map` and `val` HashMaps (size at most N+M), and the final `ans` list.  The size of the `accounts` list itself is not considered part of the space complexity of the algorithm.


The code has a minor error in the `union` function (both `par[a] = b` and `par[b] = a` should not be set simultaneously), but the logic and approach are fundamentally sound.  The corrected `union` function should choose one of the assignments (like `par[b] = a`). The time complexity analysis accounts for the fact that Union-Find operations with path compression and union by rank are nearly linear and sorting the emails adds the logarithmic component.
