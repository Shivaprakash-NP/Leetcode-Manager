## Longest Palindromic Substring Explained

Here's a breakdown of the provided Java code for finding the longest palindromic substring within a given string.

### 1. Problem Understanding

The problem asks us to find the longest substring within a given string `s` that is also a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same forwards and backward (e.g., "madam", "racecar").  We need to return this longest palindromic substring.

### 2. Approach / Intuition

The code implements an "expand around center" approach. The intuition is that palindromes are symmetrical around their center. This means we can iterate through the string, and for each character (or pair of adjacent characters) treat it as the center of a potential palindrome and expand outwards as long as the characters at the left and right pointers match.

The algorithm considers two types of centers:

1.  **Single character center:** This handles palindromes with odd length (e.g., "aba", center is 'b').  We start with `l = i` and `r = i`.
2.  **Double character center:** This handles palindromes with even length (e.g., "abba", center is "bb"). We start with `l = i` and `r = i+1`.

Why is this approach chosen?  It's relatively simple to implement and understand. It also has a reasonable time complexity compared to brute-force approaches that would check all possible substrings for palindromes.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms

*   **Data Structure:** The main data structure is the input `String s`. No complex data structures are utilized.
*   **Algorithm:** The algorithm uses the "expand around center" technique combined with two pointers (`l` and `r`). The while loop checks for palindrome conditions while expanding.

### 4. Code Walkthrough

```java
class Solution {
    public String longestPalindrome(String s) {
        String ans = ""; // Initialize the longest palindrome found so far (empty string initially).
        int len = 0;    // Initialize the length of the longest palindrome found so far (0 initially).

        for(int i = 0 ; i<s.length() ; i++) // Iterate through each character of the string.
        {
            // Case 1: Odd length palindromes (centered at s.charAt(i))
            int l = i;     // Left pointer starts at the current character.
            int r = i;     // Right pointer starts at the current character.
            while(l>=0 && r<s.length() && s.charAt(l)==s.charAt(r)) // Expand outwards as long as within bounds and characters match
            {
                if(r-l+1 > len) // If the current palindrome is longer than the longest found so far:
                {
                    ans = s.substring(l , r+1); // Update the longest palindrome.  substring(l, r+1) extracts the characters from index l (inclusive) to r (exclusive).
                    len = r-l+1;                 // Update the length of the longest palindrome.
                }
                r++;     // Move right pointer to the right.
                l--;     // Move left pointer to the left.
            }

            // Case 2: Even length palindromes (centered between s.charAt(i) and s.charAt(i+1))
            l = i;     // Left pointer starts at the current character.
            r = i+1;   // Right pointer starts at the next character.
            while(l>=0 && r<s.length() && s.charAt(l)==s.charAt(r)) // Expand outwards as long as within bounds and characters match
            {
                if(r-l+1 > len) // If the current palindrome is longer than the longest found so far:
                {
                    ans = s.substring(l , r+1); // Update the longest palindrome.
                    len = r-l+1;                 // Update the length of the longest palindrome.
                }
                r++;     // Move right pointer to the right.
                l--;     // Move left pointer to the left.
            }
        }
        return ans; // Return the longest palindromic substring found.
    }
}
```

In summary:

1.  `ans` and `len` are initialized to keep track of the longest palindrome found so far.
2.  The outer loop iterates through each character of the string, considering it as a potential center.
3.  The first inner `while` loop handles odd length palindromes, expanding outwards from the center.
4.  The second inner `while` loop handles even length palindromes, expanding outwards from the "center" between two characters.
5.  Inside the `while` loops, if a longer palindrome is found, `ans` and `len` are updated.
6.  Finally, the longest palindrome `ans` is returned.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity

*   **Time Complexity: O(n^2)**, where n is the length of the string.
    *   The outer loop iterates `n` times.
    *   The inner `while` loops, in the worst case, can iterate `n/2` times each (expanding from the center to the ends of the string).
    *   Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n * (n/2 + n/2)) which simplifies to O(n^2).

*   **Space Complexity: O(1)**
    *   The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space. The `ans` string stores the result, but its length is bounded by the length of the input string, so it doesn't contribute to a higher order of space complexity. The integer variables (`len`, `i`, `l`, `r`) use constant space.
