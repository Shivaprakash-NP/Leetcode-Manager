## Length of the Longest Alphabetical Continuous Substring

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to find the length of the longest substring within a given string `s` where the characters are in strictly increasing alphabetical order. For example, in the string "abcadefgh", "abcdefgh" is a continuous alphabetical substring of length 8.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is to iterate through the string and keep track of the current continuous substring's length. If the current character is alphabetically greater than the previous one by exactly one, we extend the current substring. If not, we reset the current substring's length to 1. We also maintain a variable to store the maximum length encountered so far.

This approach is chosen because it is a simple and efficient way to find the longest substring with a specific property (alphabetical continuity). It avoids the need for more complex data structures or algorithms. We can solve this problem by inspecting each pair of adjacent characters once.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:** No complex data structures are used. We only use primitive data types like `int` to store lengths and the input `String` itself.
*   **Algorithms:** The algorithm primarily employs a single loop and conditional statements to check for alphabetical continuity and update the current and maximum lengths. It is a form of iterative traversal and comparison.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestContinuousSubstring(String s) {
        int max = 1, curr = 1; // Initialize max and curr to 1, as a single character is a valid substring of length 1.

        for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++) { // Start from the second character (index 1)
            if (s.charAt(i) - s.charAt(i - 1) == 1) { // Check if the current character is the next alphabet in sequence
                curr++; // If it is, increment the length of the current continuous substring
            } else {
                curr = 1; // If it's not, reset the length of the current continuous substring to 1
            }
            max = Math.max(max, curr); // Update the maximum length if the current length is greater
        }
        return max; // Return the maximum length found
    }
}
```

*   **`int max = 1, curr = 1;`**: Initializes `max` and `curr` to 1. `max` stores the length of the longest continuous substring found so far. `curr` stores the length of the current continuous substring being evaluated. The initial value of 1 is correct because a single character is by definition an alphabetical substring with length 1.
*   **`for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++) { ... }`**: This loop iterates through the string `s`, starting from the second character (index 1) because we need to compare each character with its previous character.
*   **`if (s.charAt(i) - s.charAt(i - 1) == 1) { ... }`**: This `if` statement checks if the current character `s.charAt(i)` is alphabetically greater than the previous character `s.charAt(i - 1)` by exactly one. This is done by subtracting their ASCII values. If the difference is 1, it means they are consecutive in the alphabet.
*   **`curr++;`**: If the characters are consecutive, the length of the current continuous substring `curr` is incremented.
*   **`else { curr = 1; }`**: If the characters are not consecutive, the current continuous substring is broken, and the length `curr` is reset to 1 because the current character starts a new substring.
*   **`max = Math.max(max, curr);`**: After checking each character, the `max` variable is updated to store the maximum length between the current `max` and the current continuous substring length `curr`.
*   **`return max;`**: Finally, the function returns the `max` value, which represents the length of the longest alphabetical continuous substring found in the input string.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** The algorithm iterates through the string once using a single `for` loop. The operations inside the loop (character comparison and length updates) are constant time operations. Therefore, the time complexity is **O(n)**, where n is the length of the string `s`.

*   **Space Complexity:** The algorithm uses a few constant space variables (`max`, `curr`, and `i`). It does not use any additional data structures that scale with the input size. Therefore, the space complexity is **O(1)**, which represents constant space.
