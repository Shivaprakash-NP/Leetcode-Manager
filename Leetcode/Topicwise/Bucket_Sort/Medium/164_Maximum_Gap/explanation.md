## Maximum Gap Problem Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The "Maximum Gap" problem asks us to find the largest difference between adjacent elements in a sorted array of numbers. Given an unsorted array of non-negative integers, we need to find the maximum difference between successive elements *after* the array is sorted. If the array has fewer than two elements, the maximum gap is 0.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea behind this solution is straightforward:

1.  **Sort the Array:** The problem explicitly states that we need to find the maximum gap between *adjacent* elements *after* sorting. Therefore, sorting is the first necessary step.

2.  **Calculate Differences:** Once the array is sorted, we iterate through it, calculating the difference between each adjacent pair of elements.

3.  **Track Maximum Difference:** While calculating the differences, we keep track of the largest difference encountered so far.  This becomes our final answer.

The primary reason for choosing this approach is its simplicity and directness. Sorting algorithms are well-established, and once sorted, finding the maximum difference between adjacent elements is a linear-time operation. More advanced techniques like Bucket Sort exist which *can* solve this problem in linear time if the input has a specific distribution, but a general-purpose sorting algorithm works well here.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structure:** `ArrayList<Integer>` is used as temporary storage in the merge function during the mergesort process. While technically a list, it mainly serves as a buffer to hold the merged sorted portion of the array.
*   **Algorithm:**
    *   **Merge Sort:** This is the chosen sorting algorithm.  It is a divide-and-conquer algorithm with a guaranteed time complexity of O(n log n).  It's a stable sort and performs reasonably well in various scenarios.
    *   **Linear Scan:** After sorting, we perform a linear scan of the sorted array to find the maximum difference between adjacent elements.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    private void merge(int[] arr , int l , int m , int r)
    {
        ArrayList<Integer> val = new ArrayList<>();
        int le = l;
        int ri = m+1;
        while(le<=m && ri<=r)
        {
            if(arr[le]<arr[ri]) 
                val.add(arr[le++]);
            else
                val.add(arr[ri++]);
        }
        while(le<=m) val.add(arr[le++]);
        while(ri<=r) val.add(arr[ri++]);
        for(int i = 0 ; i<val.size() ; i++)
            arr[i+l] = val.get(i);
    }
    private void mergesort(int[] arr , int l , int r)
    {
        if(l>=r)return;
        int m = (l+r)/2;
        mergesort(arr , l , m);
        mergesort(arr , m+1 , r);
        merge(arr , l , m , r);
    }
    public int maximumGap(int[] nums) {
        mergesort(nums , 0 , nums.length-1);
        int max = 0;
        for(int i = 0 ; i<nums.length-1 ; i++)
        {
            max = Math.max(max , nums[i+1]-nums[i]);
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```

*   **`merge(int[] arr, int l, int m, int r)`:** This function is the core of the merge sort algorithm.
    *   It takes the array `arr` and the indices `l` (left), `m` (middle), and `r` (right) as input. It merges two sorted subarrays, `arr[l...m]` and `arr[m+1...r]`, into a single sorted subarray.
    *   `ArrayList<Integer> val = new ArrayList<>();`: Creates a temporary `ArrayList` to store the merged elements.
    *   `int le = l; int ri = m+1;`: Initializes pointers `le` and `ri` to the beginning of the left and right subarrays, respectively.
    *   `while(le<=m && ri<=r)`: This loop compares elements from the left and right subarrays and adds the smaller element to the `val` list.
    *   `while(le<=m) val.add(arr[le++]);`: Adds any remaining elements from the left subarray to `val`.
    *   `while(ri<=r) val.add(arr[ri++]);`: Adds any remaining elements from the right subarray to `val`.
    *   `for(int i = 0 ; i<val.size() ; i++) arr[i+l] = val.get(i);`: Copies the sorted elements from `val` back into the original array `arr` in the correct positions.

*   **`mergesort(int[] arr, int l, int r)`:** This function implements the recursive merge sort algorithm.
    *   It takes the array `arr` and the indices `l` (left) and `r` (right) as input, representing the subarray to be sorted.
    *   `if(l>=r) return;`: Base case: If the subarray has only one element (or is empty), it's already sorted, so we return.
    *   `int m = (l+r)/2;`: Calculates the middle index `m`.
    *   `mergesort(arr , l , m);`: Recursively sorts the left subarray `arr[l...m]`.
    *   `mergesort(arr , m+1 , r);`: Recursively sorts the right subarray `arr[m+1...r]`.
    *   `merge(arr , l , m , r);`: Merges the two sorted subarrays `arr[l...m]` and `arr[m+1...r]`.

*   **`maximumGap(int[] nums)`:** This is the main function that solves the problem.
    *   `mergesort(nums , 0 , nums.length-1);`: Sorts the input array `nums` using merge sort.
    *   `int max = 0;`: Initializes a variable `max` to store the maximum gap found so far.
    *   `for(int i = 0 ; i<nums.length-1 ; i++)`: Iterates through the sorted array, calculating the difference between adjacent elements.
    *   `max = Math.max(max , nums[i+1]-nums[i]);`: Updates `max` with the larger of its current value and the difference between `nums[i+1]` and `nums[i]`.
    *   `return max;`: Returns the maximum gap found.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:**

    *   **Merge Sort:** O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the array.  This dominates the overall time complexity.
    *   **Linear Scan:** O(n) for finding the maximum difference.
    *   **Overall:**  O(n log n) because the O(n) from the linear scan is insignificant compared to the sorting time.

*   **Space Complexity:**

    *   **Merge Sort:** O(n) in the worst case due to the auxiliary space used during the merge operation for creating the `val` ArrayList.  In-place merge sort is possible, but significantly more complex to implement.
    *   **Other variables:** O(1) for the `max` variable and loop counters.
    *   **Overall:** O(n)
