## LeetCode: All Elements in Two Binary Search Trees - Solution Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to merge all the nodes' values from two given binary search trees (BSTs) into a single sorted list.  The output should be a list containing all the values from both BSTs in ascending order.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution employs a straightforward approach leveraging the properties of BSTs.  Instead of attempting an in-order traversal during the merge, it first performs an in-order traversal of *each* BST separately to obtain two sorted lists. Then, it merges these two sorted lists using a two-pointer technique.  This approach is efficient because in-order traversal of a BST inherently yields a sorted list, making the subsequent merge simple and fast.

This method avoids the complexities of merging directly within the tree structure, which would require complex tree manipulations and comparisons at each node.  Converting to lists first simplifies the merging process considerably.

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * `TreeNode`:  Represents a node in the binary search tree.
    * `ArrayList<Integer>`: Used to store the nodes' values (integers) from each BST and the final merged result.
* **Algorithms:**
    * **Depth-First Search (DFS) (In-order Traversal):** Used to traverse each BST and extract its nodes' values in sorted order.
    * **Two-Pointers Merge:** Used to efficiently merge two sorted lists into a single sorted list.

**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **`TreeNode` Class:** This is a standard definition for a node in a binary tree, provided for clarity.

* **`dfs(TreeNode node, List<Integer> store)`:** This is a recursive helper function that performs an in-order traversal of the BST.
    * `if(node == null) return;`: Base case: If the current node is null, it stops recursion.
    * `dfs(node.left, store);`: Recursively visits the left subtree.
    * `store.add(node.val);`: Adds the current node's value to the `store` list. In-order traversal ensures this happens after the left subtree is visited but before the right.
    * `dfs(node.right, store);`: Recursively visits the right subtree.


* **`getAllElements(TreeNode root1, TreeNode root2)`:** This is the main function.
    * `List<Integer> store1 = new ArrayList<>();`: Creates a list to store values from the first BST.
    * `List<Integer> store2 = new ArrayList<>();`: Creates a list to store values from the second BST.
    * `List<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>();`: Creates a list to store the merged result.
    * `dfs(root1, store1);`: Performs in-order traversal of the first BST, storing values in `store1`.
    * `dfs(root2, store2);`: Performs in-order traversal of the second BST, storing values in `store2`.
    * `int l = 0; int r = 0;`: Initializes pointers for iterating through `store1` and `store2`.
    * The `while` loops merge the two sorted lists using the two-pointer technique. It iterates until one list is exhausted, adding the smaller element from either list to `ans` at each step.
    * The final `while` loops handle any remaining elements from either `store1` or `store2`.
    * `return ans;`: Returns the merged sorted list.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(M + N), where M and N are the number of nodes in the two BSTs respectively.  The in-order traversals take O(M) and O(N) time, and merging the two sorted lists takes O(M + N) time.

* **Space Complexity:** O(M + N). The space is dominated by the three ArrayLists: `store1`, `store2`, and `ans`.  In the worst case, all nodes from both trees will be stored in these lists, resulting in O(M + N) space usage. The recursive calls in `dfs` also contribute to the space complexity, but this is bounded by the height of the trees which is at most O(M) or O(N) in the worst case (skewed trees).  Overall, O(M+N) dominates.

This solution is optimal because it processes each node exactly once and merges the lists efficiently.  More complex tree-based merging algorithms wouldn't offer a significant performance improvement in this case, given the simplicity of the merging step after in-order traversal.
