## 3Sum Closest Problem Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The "3Sum Closest" problem asks us to find three integers in a given array `nums` such that their sum is as close as possible to a given `target` value. We need to return the sum of these three integers.  The problem assumes there is exactly one solution.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is to leverage sorting and the two-pointer technique.

1.  **Sorting:** Sorting the array allows us to efficiently search for combinations of numbers using the two-pointer approach. Without sorting, we would have to explore all possible triplets, leading to a much higher time complexity.

2.  **Two-Pointer Technique:** After sorting, we iterate through the array. For each element `nums[i]`, we use two pointers, `j` and `k`, to explore the remaining part of the array.  `j` starts from `i + 1` and moves towards the right, and `k` starts from the end of the array and moves towards the left. The idea is to adjust `j` and `k` based on whether the current sum `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k]` is greater than or less than the `target`. If the sum is greater than the `target`, we decrement `k` to try a smaller value. If the sum is less than the `target`, we increment `j` to try a larger value. This effectively narrows down the search space.

3.  **Maintaining Closest Sum:** Throughout the process, we keep track of the closest sum found so far and update it whenever we find a sum that is even closer to the `target`.

This approach is chosen because it efficiently explores the possible combinations while keeping track of the closest sum. The sorting step helps reduce the search space considerably.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:**  The primary data structure used is an `int[]` array.
*   **Algorithms:**
    *   **Sorting:** `Arrays.sort()` (typically uses quicksort or mergesort, with average time complexity O(n log n)).
    *   **Two-Pointer Technique:**  Used within the nested loops to efficiently find combinations that sum close to the target.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int threeSumClosest(int[] nums, int target) {
        Arrays.sort(nums); // Sort the input array 'nums' in ascending order.
        int ans = nums[0]+nums[1]+nums[2]; // Initialize 'ans' with the sum of the first three elements. This acts as our initial closest sum.

        for(int i = 0 ; i<nums.length-2 ; i++) // Iterate through the array, fixing the first element of the triplet.
        {
            int j = i+1; // Initialize the left pointer 'j' to the element immediately after 'i'.
            int k = nums.length-1; // Initialize the right pointer 'k' to the last element of the array.

            while(j<k) // Continue the two-pointer search as long as the left pointer 'j' is less than the right pointer 'k'.
            {
                int sum = nums[i]+nums[j]+nums[k]; // Calculate the sum of the current triplet.

                if(Math.abs(sum-target) < Math.abs(ans-target)) ans = sum; // Check if the current sum 'sum' is closer to the 'target' than the current closest sum 'ans'. If so, update 'ans' with 'sum'.

                if (sum>target) k--; // If the current sum 'sum' is greater than the 'target', move the right pointer 'k' to the left to try a smaller sum.
                else j++; // Otherwise (if the current sum 'sum' is less than or equal to the 'target'), move the left pointer 'j' to the right to try a larger sum.
            }
        }
        return ans; // Return the closest sum found.
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Arrays.sort(nums);`**: The `Arrays.sort()` method sorts the input array `nums` in ascending order. This is a crucial step for using the two-pointer approach effectively.
2.  **`int ans = nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2];`**: We initialize `ans` with the sum of the first three elements. This will be our initial "closest sum".  It's important to have an initial value to compare against.
3.  **`for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 2; i++)`**: The outer loop iterates through the array, fixing the first element (`nums[i]`) of the potential triplet. We iterate up to `nums.length - 2` because we need at least three elements to form a triplet.
4.  **`int j = i + 1;`**:  Initializes the left pointer `j` to the element immediately after `nums[i]`.
5.  **`int k = nums.length - 1;`**: Initializes the right pointer `k` to the last element of the array.
6.  **`while (j < k)`**: The inner `while` loop implements the two-pointer technique. It continues as long as the left pointer `j` is less than the right pointer `k`.
7.  **`int sum = nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k];`**: Calculates the sum of the current triplet (`nums[i]`, `nums[j]`, and `nums[k]`).
8.  **`if (Math.abs(sum - target) < Math.abs(ans - target)) ans = sum;`**: This line is the core of the logic. It compares the absolute difference between the current sum `sum` and the `target` with the absolute difference between the current closest sum `ans` and the `target`. If the current sum is closer to the `target` than the current closest sum, we update `ans` with `sum`.
9.  **`if (sum > target) k--; else j++;`**: This is the two-pointer adjustment logic.  If the current sum `sum` is greater than the `target`, we decrement the right pointer `k` to try a smaller sum. If the current sum is less than or equal to the `target`, we increment the left pointer `j` to try a larger sum.
10. **`return ans;`**: After the loops complete, the function returns the closest sum found, which is stored in the `ans` variable.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) + O(n<sup>2</sup>), which simplifies to O(n<sup>2</sup>).
    *   `Arrays.sort(nums)` takes O(n log n) time.
    *   The nested loops (outer `for` loop and inner `while` loop) take O(n<sup>2</sup>) time.  The outer loop runs `n` times, and the inner `while` loop runs at most `n` times in each iteration of the outer loop.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1). The algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space (for variables like `ans`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `sum`). The sorting algorithm might use extra space depending on the implementation (e.g., mergesort uses O(n) auxiliary space, but quicksort can be done in-place with O(log n) space on average). In this analysis, we assume the sorting is done in-place.
