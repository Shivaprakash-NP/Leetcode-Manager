## Maximum Total Damage With Spell Casting: Explained

Here's a breakdown of the Java code provided for the LeetCode problem "Maximum Total Damage With Spell Casting."

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem, in essence, asks us to maximize the total damage we can inflict by casting spells, given an array `power` where each element represents the power of a spell. The constraint is that if we cast a spell with power `v`, we cannot cast any other spell whose power is within the range `(v, v+2]` (exclusive of `v`, inclusive of `v+2`). Our objective is to select a subset of spells to cast, adhering to this constraint, such that the total damage (sum of the powers multiplied by their occurrences) is maximized.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is to use dynamic programming (specifically, recursion with memoization) to explore all possible combinations of casting spells while respecting the given constraint.

Here's the intuition:

1. **Greedy approach fails:** Casting the highest damage spells may not always be the optimal strategy. Consider powers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Casting 5 gives high damage, but you cannot cast 3,4,5 and 1,2 are valid and gives overall smaller damage. So we must explore different combinations.
2. **Overlapping Subproblems and Optimal Substructure:** The problem exhibits these two characteristics of dynamic programming. When deciding whether or not to cast a spell, we're faced with the same decision for the remaining spells. The optimal solution for the entire problem can be constructed from the optimal solutions of smaller subproblems.
3. **Avoid Redundant Calculations:** By storing the results of subproblems (memoization), we prevent recomputation and significantly improve performance.
4. **Sorting:** Sorting helps streamline the process of identifying spells that are within the forbidden range after casting a specific spell. This simplifies the logic in the recursive calls.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **`Map<Long, Long>` (HashMap):** Used to efficiently count the occurrences of each distinct power value in the input array. We convert `int` to `long` to avoid integer overflow in cases of large input arrays with significant values.
*   **`List<long[]>` (ArrayList):** Stores the power values and their total damage contribution (power * count).
*   **Sorting:** The powers are sorted to easily find the next available spell that doesn't conflict with the current spell. `Collections.sort` with a custom comparator is used.
*   **`long[] dp`:** Dynamic programming table (memoization) to store the results of subproblems. `dp[i]` stores the maximum damage achievable starting from the `i`-th unique power, considering the constraint.
*   **Recursion with Memoization:** A recursive function `rec` with a DP table (`dp`) used for memoization to find the optimal solution.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    private long rec(List<long[]> pow, int i, long l, long[] dp) {
        // Base Case: If we've reached the end of the powers list, no more damage can be done.
        if(i>=pow.size()) return 0L;

        // Memoization: If we've already computed the solution for this subproblem, return it.
        if(dp[i] != -1) return dp[i];

        long pick = 0L, nopick = 0L;
        long v = pow.get(i)[0]; // The power of the current spell.

        // Find the next index 'j' such that pow[j] does not conflict with pow[i].
        int j = i + 1;
        while (j < pow.size() && pow.get(j)[0] - v <= 2L) j++;

        // 'pick' represents the damage if we choose to cast the current spell.
        // We skip all spells with powers between (v, v+2] (exclusive of v, inclusive of v+2).
        pick = rec(pow, j, v, dp) + pow.get(i)[1];

        // 'nopick' represents the damage if we choose *not* to cast the current spell.
        nopick = rec(pow, i+1, l, dp);

        // Take the maximum damage from either picking or not picking the current spell.
        long ans = Math.max(pick, nopick);

        // Store the result in the DP table for future use.
        return dp[i] = ans;
    }

    public long maximumTotalDamage(int[] power) {
        int n = power.length;

        // Create a map to store the frequency of each power value.
        Map<Long, Long> map = new HashMap<>();

        for(int v : power) map.put((long)v, map.getOrDefault((long)v, 0L) + 1L);

        // Convert the map into a list of long[] where each element is {power, total_damage}.
        List<long[]> pow = new ArrayList<>();

        for(long v : map.keySet()) pow.add(new long[]{v, v*map.get(v)});

        // Sort the powers in ascending order.
        Collections.sort(pow, (a,b) -> Long.compare(a[0], b[0]));

        // Initialize the DP table with -1 (indicating that the values are not yet computed).
        long[] dp = new long[pow.size()+1];
        Arrays.fill(dp, -1L);

        // Start the recursion from the beginning of the sorted powers list.
        return rec(pow, 0, 0L, dp);
    }
}
```

**Detailed Explanation:**

1.  **`maximumTotalDamage(int[] power)` Function:**
    *   Takes an integer array `power` as input, representing the powers of the spells.
    *   Creates a `HashMap` called `map` to store the frequency (count) of each distinct power value in the `power` array.  This is done to calculate total damage for each power efficiently. Using `long` to avoid potential overflow issues when calculating damage.
    *   Converts the `map` into an `ArrayList` called `pow` where each element is a `long[]` of the form `{power, total_damage}`.  `total_damage` is calculated as `power * count` for each distinct power.
    *   Sorts the `pow` list based on the power values in ascending order. This is crucial for the `rec` function to efficiently find the next valid spell to cast.
    *   Initializes a `long[]` called `dp` of size `pow.size() + 1` with `-1`.  This `dp` array is used for memoization in the recursive function `rec`. `-1` indicates that the values are not yet computed.
    *   Calls the recursive helper function `rec(pow, 0, 0L, dp)` to compute the maximum total damage.  It starts from index 0 of the `pow` list. The second parameter 0 indicates the current index we are considering. The third parameter 0L indicates the last picked value, initially none.

2.  **`rec(List<long[]> pow, int i, long l, long[] dp)` Function (Recursive with Memoization):**
    *   **Base Case:** `if (i >= pow.size()) return 0L;` If the index `i` goes beyond the size of the `pow` list, it means we've considered all the spells, so the maximum damage we can achieve from this point is 0.
    *   **Memoization:** `if (dp[i] != -1) return dp[i];`  Checks if the result for the current subproblem (starting from index `i`) has already been computed and stored in the `dp` array. If so, it simply returns the stored value to avoid redundant computation.
    *   `long pick = 0L, nopick = 0L;` : Initialize the variables to store the total damage values if we include or skip the spell at current index `i`.
    *   `long v = pow.get(i)[0];`:  Retrieves the power of the current spell at index `i` from the `pow` list.
    *   **Finding Next Non-Conflicting Spell:**
        ```java
        int j = i + 1;
        while (j < pow.size() && pow.get(j)[0] - v <= 2L) j++;
        ```
        This loop finds the index `j` of the next spell that *doesn't* conflict with the current spell at index `i`. The conflict rule is: if `pow.get(j)[0]` (the power of the next spell) is within the range `(v, v+2]`, then it's in conflict. This is effectively expressed as `pow.get(j)[0] - v <= 2L`.  The loop increments `j` until it finds a spell that is not in conflict or it reaches the end of the list.

    *   **Calculating Damage if We "Pick" the Current Spell:** `pick = rec(pow, j, v, dp) + pow.get(i)[1];`  This calculates the damage if we choose to cast the spell at index `i`. We add `pow.get(i)[1]` (the total damage for the spell) to the maximum damage that can be obtained from the remaining spells, starting from index `j` (the next non-conflicting spell). The parameter `v` here doesn't serve any purpose as its value isn't being used inside `rec`. The `l` (last picked value) is to store this if there was another rule where this info would be of help.
    *   **Calculating Damage if We "Don't Pick" the Current Spell:** `nopick = rec(pow, i+1, l, dp);`  This calculates the damage if we choose *not* to cast the spell at index `i`.  We simply proceed to the next spell (index `i+1`) and recursively compute the maximum damage from that point.
    *   **Choosing the Maximum and Memoizing:**
        ```java
        long ans = Math.max(pick, nopick);
        return dp[i] = ans;
        ```
        Finally, we take the maximum of `pick` (damage if we cast the spell) and `nopick` (damage if we don't cast the spell).  This maximum value is stored in `dp[i]` for future use (memoization), and then returned.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(N log N + M), where N is the length of the input array `power` and M is the number of unique powers.
    *   O(N) for iterating through the input array `power` to build the `map`.
    *   O(M) to build the `pow` list.
    *   O(M log M) for sorting the `pow` list.
    *   O(M) for initializing the `dp` array.
    *   O(M) for the recursive function with memoization.  Each element of `dp` is computed only once, and in the worst case, the `while` loop inside `rec` can take O(M) time for each call. However, due to memoization it will execute a maximum of `M` times.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(M), where M is the number of unique powers.
    *   O(M) for storing the `map` (HashMap).
    *   O(M) for storing the `pow` list (ArrayList).
    *   O(M) for storing the `dp` array (Dynamic Programming table).
    *   O(M) for the recursion stack in the worst case.

In summary, the most significant factors are the sorting step and the memoization table, both scaling with the number of *unique* powers in the input array, and recursion stack.
