## LeetCode: Accounts Merge - Detailed Solution Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem "Accounts Merge" asks us to merge email accounts that belong to the same person.  We are given a list of accounts, where each account is a list of strings. The first string in each account is the person's name, and the remaining strings are their email addresses.  If two accounts share at least one email address, they belong to the same person and should be merged into a single account. The output should be a list of merged accounts, where each account contains the person's name followed by their unique email addresses sorted lexicographically.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The core idea is to use a Disjoint-Set Union (DSU) data structure to efficiently identify accounts belonging to the same person.  We iterate through the accounts and their email addresses.  If two email addresses belong to different accounts, we use the DSU's `union` operation to merge those accounts.  After processing all accounts, we iterate through the DSU's components, collecting the email addresses associated with each component. We then combine them with the corresponding person's name and sort the email addresses before returning the result.

This approach is chosen because DSU provides an efficient way to manage the merging of accounts. Its `find` operation helps identify the representative account for a given email, enabling fast merging of accounts that share an email.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Disjoint-Set Union (DSU):**  Used to efficiently group accounts belonging to the same person.  Implemented using `par` (parent) and `size` arrays.
* **HashMap (`map`):** Used to store a mapping between email addresses and their corresponding account indices. This allows for quick lookups during the union operation.
* **HashMap (`val`):** Used to temporarily store the merged emails for each account.
* **ArrayLists:** Used to represent individual accounts and the final list of merged accounts.
* **Union-Find Algorithm:** The core algorithm used in the DSU implementation.
* **Sorting (Collections.sort):** Used to sort the emails within each merged account.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **`accountsMerge(List<List<String>> accounts)`:** This is the main function that performs the account merging.
    * It initializes `par` and `size` arrays for the DSU.
    * It creates a `HashMap` `map` to store email-to-account mappings.
    * It iterates through the accounts, adding emails to the `map` and using the `union` function to merge accounts sharing emails.
    * It creates a `HashMap` `val` to collect emails for each merged account based on their root in the DSU.
    * It iterates through `val` to create the final list of merged accounts, adding the account's name and sorted emails.
    * Finally, it returns the list of merged accounts.

* **`find(int a)`:** This function performs path compression in the DSU.  It recursively finds the root of the set containing element `a`, and updates the parent array during the search to improve subsequent `find` operations' efficiency.

* **`union(int a, int b)`:** This function merges the sets containing elements `a` and `b` using union by rank (size).  It finds the root of each set and merges them, updating the parent and size arrays accordingly.  If `a` and `b` are already in the same set, it does nothing.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(N*M*α(N)), where N is the number of accounts, M is the maximum number of emails in a single account, and α(N) is the inverse Ackermann function which is very slowly growing, considered practically constant for all realistic inputs.  The dominant factor is the nested loop iterating through accounts and emails, but the DSU operations (find and union) have amortized time complexity close to O(1) due to path compression and union by rank. The sorting of emails contributes O(M log M) for each account, making the total sorting time O(N * M log M). But, in most cases, M log M is smaller compared to N*M.

* **Space Complexity:** O(N + M), where N is the number of accounts and M is the total number of emails. The space is used primarily for the `par`, `size`, `map`, and `val` data structures. The size of these data structures is proportional to the number of accounts and emails.


In summary, this solution efficiently solves the Accounts Merge problem using a well-chosen combination of data structures and algorithms, providing a solution with near-linear time complexity in practical scenarios.
