## Set Mismatch Problem Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The "Set Mismatch" problem asks us to find two numbers in an array of integers `nums`. The array is supposed to contain numbers from 1 to *n* (where *n* is the size of the array) but it contains exactly one duplicate number and one missing number. The problem requires us to identify the duplicate number (let's call it *x*) and the missing number (let's call it *y*) and return them in an array `[x, y]`.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea behind this solution is to use mathematical formulas to calculate the expected sum and sum of squares of numbers from 1 to *n* and then compare them with the actual sum and sum of squares of the numbers in the given array `nums`. The differences between these values will provide equations that can be solved to find the duplicate and missing numbers.

Specifically, we leverage these equations:

*   **Sum of first *n* natural numbers:**  *n*(n+1)/2
*   **Sum of squares of first *n* natural numbers:** *n*(n+1)(2*n+1)/6

Let *x* be the duplicate number and *y* be the missing number.

1.  Calculate the expected sum and sum of squares from 1 to *n* using the formulas above. Store these as `a_sum` and `a_srsum`.

2.  Calculate the actual sum and sum of squares of the array `nums`. Store these as `sum` and `sr_sum`.

3.  The difference between the actual sum and the expected sum will be `x - y` (duplicate minus missing). This gives us our first equation: `x_minus_y = sum - a_sum`.

4.  The difference between the actual sum of squares and the expected sum of squares will be `x^2 - y^2`. This gives us our second equation: `x_minus_y2 = sr_sum - a_srsum`.

5.  Since `x^2 - y^2 = (x + y) * (x - y)`, we can divide the second equation by the first equation to get `x + y`: `x_plus_y = x_minus_y2 / x_minus_y`.

6.  Now we have two equations:

    *   `x - y = x_minus_y`
    *   `x + y = x_plus_y`

7.  Solve these two equations simultaneously for *x* and *y*.  `x = (x_plus_y + x_minus_y) / 2` and `y = x_plus_y - x`.

8.  Return the duplicate (*x*) and missing (*y*) numbers in an array.

This approach is chosen because it avoids using extra space (like hash tables or sets) and offers a computationally efficient solution by relying on simple arithmetic operations.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:**  The code primarily uses integer variables and a `int[]` array to store and return the result.
*   **Algorithms:**  This solution employs mathematical formulas for sum and sum of squares calculation. It also uses basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to solve the equations.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] findErrorNums(int[] nums) {
        long n = nums.length; // Get the length of the input array and store it as a long to prevent potential integer overflow.
        long a_sum = n*(n+1)/2;  // Calculate the expected sum of numbers from 1 to n.
        long a_srsum = n*(n+1)*(2*n+1) / 6;  // Calculate the expected sum of squares of numbers from 1 to n.
        long sum = 0;  // Initialize the variable to store the actual sum of numbers in the array.
        long sr_sum = 0; // Initialize the variable to store the actual sum of squares of numbers in the array.
        for(int v : nums) { // Iterate through each element v in the array nums.
            sum += (long)v;  // Add the current element to the running sum. Cast v to long to prevent overflow.
            sr_sum += (long)(v*v);  // Add the square of the current element to the running sum of squares.  Cast v*v to long to prevent overflow.
        }
        long x_minus_y = sum-a_sum; // Calculate the difference between the actual sum and the expected sum, which equals x - y.
        long x_minus_y2 = sr_sum - a_srsum; // Calculate the difference between the actual sum of squares and the expected sum of squares, which equals x^2 - y^2.
        long x_plus_y = x_minus_y2 / x_minus_y; // Calculate x + y by dividing x^2 - y^2 by x - y.
        long x = ( x_plus_y + x_minus_y ) / 2; // Solve for x (the duplicate number) using the equations x - y and x + y.
        long y = x_plus_y - x; // Solve for y (the missing number) using the equations x - y and x + y.
        return new int[]{(int)x,(int)y}; // Return the duplicate number (x) and the missing number (y) as an array. Cast x and y back to int for the final result.
    }
}
```

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** The code iterates through the `nums` array once to calculate the sum and sum of squares.  All other operations are constant time. Therefore, the time complexity is **O(n)**, where *n* is the length of the array.

*   **Space Complexity:** The code uses a few variables to store intermediate results, but the amount of memory used doesn't depend on the size of the input array.  The space used is constant.  Therefore, the space complexity is **O(1)**.
