## LeetCode "Merge Sorted Array" Problem Explanation

Here's a detailed explanation of the provided Java code for the LeetCode "Merge Sorted Array" problem.

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem "Merge Sorted Array" requires us to merge two sorted integer arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, into a single sorted array. The merged array should be stored in `nums1`. We are given:

*   `nums1`:  The target array, which is large enough to hold all elements from both arrays. The first `m` elements of `nums1` are the elements to be merged. The rest of `nums1` is initialized to 0 and should be overwritten with elements from `nums2`.
*   `m`: The number of elements in `nums1` that need to be merged.
*   `nums2`: The second sorted array.
*   `n`: The number of elements in `nums2`.

In essence, we need to combine the sorted portions of `nums1` (up to index `m-1`) and `nums2` (up to index `n-1`) into a single sorted array that overwrites `nums1` completely (up to index `m+n-1`).

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The provided code takes a straightforward, albeit not the most efficient, approach:

1.  **Copy `nums2` into the empty space of `nums1`:** It iterates through the available space at the end of `nums1` (from index `m` to `m+n-1`) and copies elements from `nums2` into those positions.
2.  **Sort `nums1`:**  It then uses the `Arrays.sort()` method to sort the entire `nums1` array, including the elements just copied from `nums2`.

The intuition is simple: merge the arrays by placing `nums2` at the end of `nums1`, then sort the resulting `nums1`. While easy to implement, the final sorting step can be costly.

The reason this approach *might* have been chosen (although a more efficient approach would be favored in a real interview or coding scenario) is its simplicity and ease of understanding. It avoids complex pointer manipulations and directly utilizes the built-in sorting functionality.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:** The primary data structure is the `int[]` array (both `nums1` and `nums2`).
*   **Algorithms:**
    *   **Array Copying (Iteration):**  A simple loop is used to copy elements from `nums2` to the end of `nums1`.
    *   **Sorting:** The `Arrays.sort()` method, which typically uses a variant of quicksort or mergesort (depending on the Java version), is the core algorithm for sorting the merged array.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public void merge(int[] nums1, int m, int[] nums2, int n) {
        for(int i = m ; i<m+n ; i++)
            nums1[i] = nums2[i-m];
        Arrays.sort(nums1);
    }
}
```

1.  **`class Solution { ... }`:**  This defines the class that contains the `merge` method.  LeetCode solutions are generally structured this way.

2.  **`public void merge(int[] nums1, int m, int[] nums2, int n) { ... }`:**
    *   This is the `merge` method, which takes four arguments as described in the "Problem Understanding" section.
    *   The `void` return type indicates that the modification happens directly in the `nums1` array, and no new array is returned.

3.  **`for(int i = m ; i<m+n ; i++)`:**
    *   This `for` loop iterates from `i = m` up to (but not including) `m + n`.  This corresponds to the empty portion of `nums1` where we want to copy `nums2`.

4.  **`nums1[i] = nums2[i-m];`:**
    *   Inside the loop, this line copies elements from `nums2` to `nums1`.  Let's break it down:
        *   `nums1[i]` is the element in `nums1` that we are assigning a value to.  The index `i` starts at `m` and goes up to `m+n-1`.
        *   `nums2[i-m]` is the element in `nums2` that we are copying. The index `i-m` correctly accesses `nums2` from index 0 to `n-1`.  For instance:
            *   When `i = m`, `i - m = 0`, so `nums2[0]` is copied to `nums1[m]`.
            *   When `i = m + 1`, `i - m = 1`, so `nums2[1]` is copied to `nums1[m+1]`.
            *   And so on, until `i = m + n - 1`, where `i - m = n - 1`, so `nums2[n-1]` is copied to `nums1[m+n-1]`.

5.  **`Arrays.sort(nums1);`:**
    *   After copying all elements from `nums2` to `nums1`, this line sorts the entire `nums1` array using the built-in `Arrays.sort()` method.  This ensures that the final `nums1` array is sorted in ascending order.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:**
    *   The `for` loop iterates `n` times, resulting in a time complexity of O(n).
    *   The `Arrays.sort(nums1)` method has an average time complexity of O((m+n) log(m+n)), as it needs to sort the entire `nums1` array, which has a size of `m + n`.
    *   Therefore, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, making it **O((m+n) log(m+n))**.

*   **Space Complexity:**
    *   The algorithm operates in-place; it modifies the `nums1` array directly without using any significant extra space.  The `Arrays.sort()` method might use some auxiliary space depending on the implementation, but it is generally considered to be O(log(m+n)) or O(1) in many practical scenarios.
    *   Therefore, the overall space complexity is **O(1)** (constant space).

**In summary:**  The provided solution is relatively simple to understand but not the most efficient. A better approach (with O(m+n) time complexity) would involve using three pointers and merging the arrays directly from the end, avoiding the need to sort the entire array at the end.
