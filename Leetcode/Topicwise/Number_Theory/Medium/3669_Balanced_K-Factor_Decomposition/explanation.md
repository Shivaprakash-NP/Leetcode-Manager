## Balanced K-Factor Decomposition

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to find `k` factors of a given integer `n` such that the difference between the largest and smallest factors is minimized. We need to return an array of these `k` factors.  The `k` factors, when multiplied together, should equal `n`.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is to use backtracking to explore all possible ways to distribute the prime factors of `n` among the `k` factors.

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Prime Factorization:** First, decompose the given number `n` into its prime factors.  This is crucial because any factor of `n` can be formed by multiplying some combination of these prime factors.
2. **Backtracking:** Use backtracking to distribute these prime factors into `k` groups (factors).  At each step, we consider a prime factor and try assigning it to each of the `k` current factors.  The backtracking function explores each assignment recursively.
3. **Difference Minimization:** After each possible assignment of all prime factors, we calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum factors among the `k` groups. We maintain the best split (the set of `k` factors) that yields the minimum difference encountered so far.
4. **Optimization (Avoiding Redundant Computations):** The `triedValues` set within the backtracking function is used to avoid redundant computations. It prevents assigning a factor to a current factor that it already attempted in that level of recursion if the factor value is the same. Also it checks for overflow before multiplying to ensure the calculation stays in the allowed integer range.

Why this approach? Backtracking is well-suited for this problem because we need to explore all combinations of assigning the prime factors to the k factors, and it allows us to keep track of the current combination.  This ensures that we find the optimal balanced k-factor decomposition.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **`List<Integer> primeFactors`:** Stores the prime factors of `n`. An `ArrayList` is used for dynamic resizing.
*   **`int[] currentSplit`:** An array of size `k` to store the current `k` factors being considered.
*   **`int[] bestSplit`:** An array of size `k` to store the factors of the best split found so far.
*   **`long minDifference`:** Stores the minimum difference found between the maximum and minimum values in `currentSplit`.
*   **`HashSet<Integer> triedValues`:** Optimization for the backtracking, to avoid redundant calculations and improve performance.

*   **Algorithms:**
    *   **Prime Factorization:** Used to find the prime factors of `n`.
    *   **Backtracking:** The main algorithm to explore all possible factor combinations.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    private long minDifference = Long.MAX_VALUE;
    private int[] bestSplit;

    public int[] minDifference(int n, int k) {
        if (k == 1) {
            return new int[]{n};
        }

        // 1. Prime Factorization:
        List<Integer> primeFactors = new ArrayList<>();
        int tempN = n;
        while (tempN % 2 == 0) {
            primeFactors.add(2);
            tempN /= 2;
        }
        for (int i = 3; i * i <= tempN; i += 2) {
            while (tempN % i == 0) {
                primeFactors.add(i);
                tempN /= i;
            }
        }
        if (tempN > 1) {
            primeFactors.add(tempN);
        }

        // Helper Class
        class Sulmariton {
            int n_val;
            int k_val;
            Sulmariton(int n, int k) { this.n_val = n; this.k_val = k; }
        }
        Sulmariton sulmariton = new Sulmariton(n, k);

        this.bestSplit = new int[k];
        this.minDifference = Long.MAX_VALUE;
        int[] currentSplit = new int[k];
        Arrays.fill(currentSplit, 1);

        primeFactors.sort(Collections.reverseOrder());
        
        // 2. Backtracking Initialization:
        backtrack(0, primeFactors, currentSplit, k);

        return this.bestSplit;
    }

    private void backtrack(int factorIndex, List<Integer> primeFactors, int[] currentSplit, int k) {
        // Base Case: All prime factors have been assigned
        if (factorIndex == primeFactors.size()) {
            long maxVal = 0;
            long minVal = Long.MAX_VALUE;
            for (int val : currentSplit) {
                maxVal = Math.max(maxVal, val);
                minVal = Math.min(minVal, val);
            }

            if (maxVal - minVal < this.minDifference) {
                this.minDifference = maxVal - minVal;
                this.bestSplit = currentSplit.clone();
            }
            return;
        }

        int factor = primeFactors.get(factorIndex);

        Set<Integer> triedValues = new HashSet<>();

        // Iterate through each of the k factors
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            //Optimization to avoid redundant calculations
            if (triedValues.contains(currentSplit[i])) {
                continue;
            }

            //check for overflow, avoid integer overflow
            if ((long) currentSplit[i] * factor > Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
                continue;
            }
            
            triedValues.add(currentSplit[i]);
            
            // Assign the current prime factor to the i-th factor
            currentSplit[i] *= factor;
            // Recursively call backtrack for the next prime factor
            backtrack(factorIndex + 1, primeFactors, currentSplit, k);
            // Backtrack: Undo the assignment to explore other possibilities
            currentSplit[i] /= factor;
        }
    }
}
```

*   **`minDifference(int n, int k)`:**
    *   Handles the base case where `k` is 1 (return `n` as the only factor).
    *   Calculates the prime factorization of `n`.  It first extracts all factors of 2, and then iterates through odd numbers to find other prime factors.
    *   Sorts the prime factors in descending order.  This is a heuristic that helps find a balanced decomposition faster.
    *   Initializes `bestSplit` and `minDifference`.
    *   Initializes `currentSplit` with all factors set to 1.
    *   Calls the `backtrack` function to start the search.
    *   Returns the `bestSplit`.
*   **`backtrack(int factorIndex, List<Integer> primeFactors, int[] currentSplit, int k)`:**
    *   **Base Case:** If `factorIndex` reaches the end of `primeFactors`, it means all prime factors have been assigned. Calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `currentSplit` and update `minDifference` and `bestSplit` if a better split is found.
    *   Retrieves the current prime factor from `primeFactors`.
    *   Iterates through each of the `k` factors in `currentSplit`.
        *   It checks for `triedValues` to avoid redundant calculations.
        *   Assigns the current prime factor to `currentSplit[i]`.
        *   Recursively calls `backtrack` to move to the next prime factor.
        *   Backtracks by undoing the assignment (`currentSplit[i] /= factor`) to explore other possibilities.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:**  O(k<sup>P</sup>), where P is the number of prime factors of n (with repetition). In the worst case, we are exploring every possible way to assign each prime factor to each of the k factors. The prime factorization is O(sqrt(n)), but this is dominated by the backtracking. The `triedValues` helps prune the search space and thus improve performance, but the worst-case remains exponential.

*   **Space Complexity:** O(P + k), where P is the number of prime factors of `n`.
    *   O(P) for the `primeFactors` list.
    *   O(k) for the `currentSplit` and `bestSplit` arrays.
    *   O(k) for the `triedValues` set in the worst case (each current factor is different in one level).
    *   The recursion stack can grow up to O(P) deep.
