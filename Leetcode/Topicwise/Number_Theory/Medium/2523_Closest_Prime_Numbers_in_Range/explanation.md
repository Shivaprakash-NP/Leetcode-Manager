## Closest Prime Numbers in Range

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to find the two closest prime numbers within a given range `[left, right]`.  "Closest" is defined as having the smallest difference between them. We need to return an array of size 2 containing the two closest prime numbers. If no two primes exist in the given range, or there is only one prime in the range, we should return `[-1, -1]`.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The main idea is to first generate all prime numbers within the given range using the Sieve of Eratosthenes. Then, we iterate through the generated prime numbers to find the pair with the smallest difference.  We keep track of the last prime found and calculate the difference between the current prime and the last prime. If this difference is smaller than the current minimum difference, we update the minimum difference and the pair of prime numbers.

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is chosen because it is an efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers within a given range. Once we have the list of primes, finding the closest pair is a straightforward linear scan.  Alternatives like trial division would be less efficient for finding all primes in the range, especially for larger ranges.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `boolean[] is`:  This boolean array, indexed from 0 to `right`, stores whether a number is prime or not. `is[i]` is `true` if `i` is prime, and `false` otherwise.
    *   `int[] ans`: An array of size 2 to store the two closest prime numbers found.
*   **Algorithms:**
    *   **Sieve of Eratosthenes:**  This algorithm is used to efficiently generate all prime numbers up to `right`.
    *   **Linear Scan:**  We iterate through the boolean array to find prime numbers and keep track of the closest pair.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] closestPrimes(int left, int right) {
        int[] ans = new int[]{-1 , -1}; // Initialize the answer array to [-1, -1]
        int l = left;
        int r = right;
        boolean[] is = new boolean[r+1]; // Create a boolean array to store prime status of numbers up to 'right'
        Arrays.fill(is , true); // Initially, assume all numbers are prime
        is[0] = false; // 0 is not prime
        is[1] = false; // 1 is not prime

        // Sieve of Eratosthenes: Mark non-prime numbers
        for(int i = 2 ; i*i<=r ; i++)
            if(is[i]) // If 'i' is prime
                for(int j = i*i ; j<=r ; j+=i) // Mark all multiples of 'i' as non-prime
                    is[j] = false;

        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE; // Initialize the minimum difference to the maximum possible integer value
        int last = -1; // Initialize the last prime found to -1
        for(int i = l ; i<=r ; i++) { // Iterate through the range [left, right]
            if(!is[i]) continue; // If 'i' is not prime, skip to the next number
            if(last != -1 && i-last < min) { // If we have found a previous prime and the difference between the current prime and the last prime is less than the current minimum difference
                min = i-last; // Update the minimum difference
                ans[0] = last; // Update the first prime in the answer array
                ans[1] = i; // Update the second prime in the answer array
            }
            last = i; // Update the last prime found to the current prime
        }

        return ans; // Return the answer array
    }
}
```

*   **`int[] ans = new int[]{-1 , -1};`**: Initializes the `ans` array to `[-1, -1]`. This is the default return value if no two primes are found in the range.

*   **`boolean[] is = new boolean[r+1];`**:  Creates a boolean array `is` of size `right + 1`. This array will be used to store whether each number from 0 to `right` is prime or not.

*   **`Arrays.fill(is , true);`**: Initially sets all elements of the `is` array to `true`, assuming all numbers are prime.

*   **`is[0] = false; is[1] = false;`**:  Sets `is[0]` and `is[1]` to `false` because 0 and 1 are not prime numbers.

*   **Sieve of Eratosthenes:**
    *   **`for(int i = 2 ; i*i<=r ; i++)`**:  This loop iterates from 2 up to the square root of `right`. We only need to iterate up to the square root because any composite number `n` must have a factor less than or equal to the square root of `n`.
    *   **`if(is[i])`**: Checks if `i` is prime. If `is[i]` is `true`, it means that `i` is prime.
    *   **`for(int j = i*i ; j<=r ; j+=i)`**:  If `i` is prime, this inner loop iterates through all multiples of `i` starting from `i*i` and marks them as not prime by setting `is[j]` to `false`. We start from `i*i` because all smaller multiples of `i` would have already been marked as not prime by smaller prime numbers.

*   **Finding the Closest Primes:**
    *   **`int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;`**: Initializes `min` to the maximum possible integer value. This variable will store the minimum difference between two consecutive prime numbers found so far.
    *   **`int last = -1;`**:  Initializes `last` to `-1`. This variable will store the last prime number found.
    *   **`for(int i = l ; i<=r ; i++)`**: This loop iterates through the given range `[left, right]`.
    *   **`if(!is[i]) continue;`**: If `is[i]` is `false`, it means that `i` is not prime, so we skip to the next number.
    *   **`if(last != -1 && i-last < min)`**:  If `last` is not `-1` (meaning we have found at least one prime number) and the difference between the current prime number `i` and the last prime number `last` is less than the current minimum difference `min`, then we update the `min` and `ans` variables.
    *   **`min = i-last;`**: Updates `min` to the new minimum difference.
    *   **`ans[0] = last; ans[1] = i;`**:  Updates the `ans` array with the two closest prime numbers found so far.
    *   **`last = i;`**:  Updates `last` to the current prime number `i`.

*   **`return ans;`**: Returns the `ans` array containing the two closest prime numbers found in the range `[left, right]`.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:**
    *   The Sieve of Eratosthenes takes O(n log log n) time, where n is `right` in our case.
    *   The linear scan takes O(n) time, where n is `right - left + 1`, i.e., number of elements in the range [left, right].
    *   Therefore, the overall time complexity is dominated by Sieve of Eratosthenes, which is **O(right log log right)**.
*   **Space Complexity:**
    *   The boolean array `is` takes O(right + 1) space.
    *   The `ans` array takes O(1) space.
    *   Therefore, the overall space complexity is **O(right)**.
