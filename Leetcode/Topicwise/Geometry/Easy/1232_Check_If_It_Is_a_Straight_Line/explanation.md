## Check If It Is a Straight Line - Java Solution Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to determine whether a given set of points, represented as a 2D integer array `coordinates`, lie on a straight line. The `coordinates` array contains pairs of `[x, y]` values representing the coordinates of each point. We need to return `true` if all the points lie on the same straight line, and `false` otherwise.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is to check if the slope between any two consecutive pairs of points is consistent throughout the entire set of points.  Rather than directly calculating slopes (which would involve division and potential issues with vertical lines where the denominator is zero), we can compare the "cross products" of the vectors formed by consecutive point pairs.

Specifically, consider three points `(x1, y1)`, `(x2, y2)`, and `(x3, y3)`.  If these points lie on a straight line, the slope between the first two points must be equal to the slope between the last two points.  Mathematically:

`(y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (y3 - y2) / (x3 - x2)`

To avoid division, we can rewrite this as:

`(y2 - y1) * (x3 - x2) = (y3 - y2) * (x2 - x1)`

This equation essentially checks if the vectors formed by the first two points and the last two points are parallel (i.e., the points are collinear). The provided code checks this condition for all consecutive triplets of points.

This approach is chosen because it avoids floating-point arithmetic, which can be prone to precision errors, and avoids division by zero issues with vertical lines. It leverages the property that the slope between any two points on the same line is constant.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:** The code uses a 2D integer array (`int[][] coordinates`) to store the coordinates of the points.  No other significant data structures are used.
*   **Algorithms:**  The core algorithm is based on the concept of comparing "cross products" to check for collinearity.  It essentially implements a linear traversal of the points with a constant-time comparison operation in each iteration.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean checkStraightLine(int[][] coordinates) {
        for(int i = 0; i<coordinates.length-2 ; i++) {
            int v1 = (coordinates[i+1][1]-coordinates[i][1])*(coordinates[i+2][0]-coordinates[i+1][0]);
            int v2 = (coordinates[i+2][1]-coordinates[i+1][1])*(coordinates[i+1][0]-coordinates[i][0]);
            if(v1 != v2) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

1.  **`class Solution { ... }`**: This defines the `Solution` class where the main logic resides.

2.  **`public boolean checkStraightLine(int[][] coordinates) { ... }`**:  This is the method that takes the 2D array `coordinates` as input and returns `true` if the points form a straight line, `false` otherwise.

3.  **`for(int i = 0; i<coordinates.length-2 ; i++) { ... }`**: This loop iterates through the `coordinates` array, taking three points at a time to check for collinearity.
    *   `i = 0;`: The loop starts at the first point (index 0).
    *   `i < coordinates.length - 2;`:  The loop continues as long as there are at least three points remaining to form a triplet.  The loop stops `coordinates.length-2` because in each iteration, it checks points at `i`, `i+1`, and `i+2`.
    *   `i++`: The loop increments `i` to move to the next triplet of points.

4.  **`int v1 = (coordinates[i+1][1]-coordinates[i][1])*(coordinates[i+2][0]-coordinates[i+1][0]);`**: This line calculates the first part of the cross-product-like comparison, which is `(y2 - y1) * (x3 - x2)`.
    *   `coordinates[i+1][1] - coordinates[i][1]`: Calculates `y2 - y1`
    *   `coordinates[i+2][0] - coordinates[i+1][0]`: Calculates `x3 - x2`

5.  **`int v2 = (coordinates[i+2][1]-coordinates[i+1][1])*(coordinates[i+1][0]-coordinates[i][0]);`**: This line calculates the second part of the cross-product-like comparison, which is `(y3 - y2) * (x2 - x1)`.
    *   `coordinates[i+2][1] - coordinates[i+1][1]`: Calculates `y3 - y2`
    *   `coordinates[i+1][0] - coordinates[i][0]`: Calculates `x2 - x1`

6.  **`if(v1 != v2) return false;`**: This is the crucial check. If the two "cross product" values `v1` and `v2` are not equal, it means the three points `(x1, y1)`, `(x2, y2)`, and `(x3, y3)` are *not* collinear, and the function immediately returns `false`.

7.  **`return true;`**: If the loop completes without finding any non-collinear triplets of points, it means all the points lie on a straight line, and the function returns `true`.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of points in the `coordinates` array. This is because the code iterates through the array once using a `for` loop.  Each iteration performs constant-time operations (arithmetic calculations and comparisons).
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1). The code uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input size. It only uses a few integer variables to store intermediate calculations, which do not depend on the size of the input.
