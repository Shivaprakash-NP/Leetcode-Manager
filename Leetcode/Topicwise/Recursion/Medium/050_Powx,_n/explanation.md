## Pow(x, n) - LeetCode Problem Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to implement the power function `pow(x, n)`, which calculates `x` raised to the power `n` (i.e., x<sup>n</sup>).  `x` is a double, and `n` is an integer which can be positive, negative, or zero. We need to handle all possible cases efficiently.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is to use the **exponentiation by squaring** algorithm (also known as binary exponentiation).  A naive solution of multiplying `x` by itself `n` times would be too slow (O(n) time complexity). Exponentiation by squaring dramatically improves performance by leveraging the following properties of exponents:

*   **x<sup>n</sup> = (x<sup>n/2</sup>)<sup>2</sup>** if n is even
*   **x<sup>n</sup> = x * (x<sup>(n-1)/2</sup>)<sup>2</sup>** if n is odd

This allows us to repeatedly square `x` and halve `n` until `n` becomes 0.  Whenever we encounter an odd `n`, we multiply the result `ans` by the current value of `x`.

Why this approach?  It significantly reduces the number of operations needed. Instead of performing 'n' multiplications, we are performing a logarithmic number of operations, specifically O(log n). This is especially important when dealing with large values of `n`.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Algorithm:** Exponentiation by Squaring (Binary Exponentiation)
*   **Data Structures:** No complex data structures are used.  We only use primitive data types like `double` and `long`.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public double myPow(double x, int n) {
        long N = n;
        if(n<0)
        {
            x = 1/x;
            N = -N;
        }
        double ans = 1;
        while(N>0)
        {
            if((N & 1)==1) ans *= x;
            x *= x;
            N >>= 1;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

*   **`public double myPow(double x, int n)`:** This is the function definition, taking the base `x` (double) and exponent `n` (int) as input and returning the result as a double.

*   **`long N = n;`**:  This line converts the integer `n` to a `long` type and stores it in `N`. This is done to handle the case where `n` is `Integer.MIN_VALUE`. Negating `Integer.MIN_VALUE` would cause an overflow, leading to incorrect behavior. By using `long`, we can safely represent the absolute value of the exponent.

*   **`if(n<0)`**: This conditional block handles negative exponents.
    *   **`x = 1/x;`**: If `n` is negative, we invert the base `x` (i.e., x becomes 1/x). This is because x<sup>-n</sup> = (1/x)<sup>n</sup>.
    *   **`N = -N;`**: We then make `N` (the exponent) positive for easier processing in the subsequent loop.

*   **`double ans = 1;`**: This initializes the result `ans` to 1. This is the identity value for multiplication (x<sup>0</sup> = 1).

*   **`while(N>0)`**:  This loop implements the core exponentiation by squaring logic. The loop continues as long as the exponent `N` is greater than 0.

    *   **`if((N & 1)==1)`**: This checks if `N` is odd.  The `&` operator performs a bitwise AND.  `N & 1` extracts the least significant bit of `N`. If the least significant bit is 1, then `N` is odd.
        *   **`ans *= x;`**: If `N` is odd, we multiply the current result `ans` by the current value of `x`. This corresponds to the case where x<sup>n</sup> = x * (x<sup>(n-1)/2</sup>)<sup>2</sup>.

    *   **`x *= x;`**:  We square `x` in each iteration.  This is because we are effectively reducing the exponent by half in each step (either by halving directly or by subtracting 1 and then halving).

    *   **`N >>= 1;`**: We right-shift `N` by 1 bit. This is equivalent to dividing `N` by 2 (integer division).  This reduces the exponent in each step.

*   **`return ans;`**: After the loop finishes (when `N` becomes 0), the function returns the calculated result `ans`.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity: O(log n)**. The `while` loop iterates a number of times proportional to the number of bits in `n`, which is logarithmic in `n`. The operations inside the loop (bitwise AND, multiplication, right shift) take constant time.
*   **Space Complexity: O(1)**.  The solution uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input size. We only use a few variables (`N`, `ans`, `x`), whose memory usage does not depend on `n`.
