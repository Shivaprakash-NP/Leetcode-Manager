### 1. Intuition

The problem asks us to find the maximum number of stones we can remove such that no two remaining stones share the same row or column.  Imagine the stones as nodes in a graph.  Two stones are connected if they share a row or a column.  Removing stones is equivalent to finding the number of connected components in this graph minus the total number of stones.  The problem boils down to efficiently finding connected components in this graph.  We'll use a disjoint-set union (DSU) algorithm for this purpose.

### 2. Approach

1. **Find Maximum Row and Column Indices:** The code first iterates through the `stones` array to find the maximum row index (`r`) and maximum column index (`c`). This determines the size of our disjoint-set data structures.

2. **Initialize Disjoint-Set Union:** A disjoint-set union (DSU) data structure is initialized.  `par` array stores the parent of each node (initially, each node is its own parent), and `size` array tracks the size of each component.  We use `r + c + 2` elements because we represent rows and columns as separate nodes in the DSU.  Row indices are directly used, while column indices are shifted by `r + 1` to avoid conflicts.

3. **Union Operations:** The code iterates through the `stones` again. For each stone `(row, col)`, it performs a union operation between the row node (`row`) and the column node (`col + r + 1`).  This connects stones that share a row or column within the DSU. The `union` function uses union by size for efficiency.

4. **Find Connected Components:** After all union operations, the code iterates through the stones once more. For each stone, it uses the `find` function to find the root (representative) of the connected component for both its row and column. These root values are stored in a `HashSet` called `set`.  The `HashSet` only keeps track of unique component representatives.

5. **Calculate Removed Stones:** Finally, the code returns the number of stones minus the number of unique connected components found.  This gives the maximum number of stones that can be removed.


### 3. Data Structures

- **`par` (int array):**  The parent array for the disjoint-set union. `par[i]` stores the parent of node `i`.
- **`size` (int array):** The size array for the disjoint-set union. `size[i]` stores the size of the component containing node `i`.
- **`stones` (int[][]):**  The input array, where each inner array represents a stone with its row and column coordinates.
- **`set` (HashSet):**  A HashSet to store the unique representative nodes of the connected components, effectively counting the components.

### 4. Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(N*α(N)), where N is the number of stones and α(N) is the inverse Ackermann function, which is effectively a constant for all practical input sizes.  The dominant operations are the union and find operations in the DSU, which have amortized time complexity of α(N) due to path compression and union by size.

- **Space Complexity:** O(R+C), where R and C are the maximum row and column indices, respectively. This is the space used by the `par` and `size` arrays, which are proportional to the maximum row and column indices. The HashSet `set` has a maximum size of R + C, contributing to the space complexity as well.  In the worst case (all stones in distinct rows and columns), this space complexity is O(N).
