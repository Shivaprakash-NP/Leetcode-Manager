## LeetCode: Find the City With the Smallest Number of Neighbors at a Threshold Distance

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the city (represented by an index) with the fewest number of cities within a given distance threshold.  We're given the number of cities, a list of weighted edges representing connections between cities, and the distance threshold.  The weights represent the distances between directly connected cities.  We need to find the city that has the minimum number of reachable cities within the specified distance threshold.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution uses Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find the shortest paths between all pairs of cities.  This is an all-pairs shortest path algorithm, suitable because we need to know the shortest distance between every pair of cities to determine which city satisfies the condition. After computing the shortest path distances, the algorithm iterates through each city, counting the number of cities reachable within the threshold distance. The city with the minimum count is returned. Floyd-Warshall is chosen because it efficiently handles all pairs of nodes and the graph is represented as an adjacency matrix.  Other algorithms like Dijkstra's could be used for single-source shortest paths, but that would require repeated applications to cover all possible starting nodes, making it less efficient than Floyd-Warshall for this specific problem.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * `map`: A 2D array (adjacency matrix) to store the shortest distances between all pairs of cities.  `map[i][j]` represents the shortest distance between city `i` and city `j`.
* **Algorithms:**
    * **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:** Used to compute the shortest paths between all pairs of cities.
    * **Iteration:** Used to count the number of reachable cities within the threshold for each city.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **Initialization:**
    ```java
    int[][] map = new int[n][n];
    int INF = 100000000; 

    for(int i = 0; i<n; i++) {
        Arrays.fill(map[i], INF);
        map[i][i] = 0;
    }
    ```
    This part initializes the `map` with a large value (`INF`) representing infinity for all pairs of cities. The diagonal elements (`map[i][i]`) are set to 0 because the distance from a city to itself is 0.

* **Edge Processing:**
    ```java
    for(int[] e : edges) {
        int u = e[0];
        int v = e[1];
        int w = e[2];
        map[u][v] = w;
        map[v][u] = w;
    }
    ```
    This section populates the `map` with the initial direct edge weights from the input `edges`.  It's crucial to note that the graph is assumed to be undirected, hence the weights are added in both `map[u][v]` and `map[v][u]`.

* **Floyd-Warshall Implementation:**
    ```java
    for(int v = 0; v<n; v++) {
        for(int i = 0; i<n; i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j<n; j++) {
                map[i][j] = Math.min(map[i][v]+map[v][j], map[i][j]);
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    This is the core of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. It iterates through all possible intermediate nodes (`v`) to find the shortest path between each pair of cities (`i` and `j`).  It updates `map[i][j]` with the minimum of the current value and the path through `v`.

* **City Counting and Result Selection:**
    ```java
    int ans = 0;
    int rec = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    for(int i = 0; i<n; i++) {
        int c = 0;
        for(int j = 0; j<n; j++) {
            if(i!=j && map[i][j] <= distanceThreshold) c++;
        }
        if(c <= rec) {
            rec = c;
            ans = i;
        }
    }
    return ans;
    ```
    This final part iterates through each city (`i`) and counts the number of cities (`c`) reachable within the `distanceThreshold`.  It keeps track of the city with the minimum count (`rec`) and updates `ans` accordingly.  The index of the city with the smallest number of neighbors within the threshold is returned.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(n³), dominated by the Floyd-Warshall algorithm's triple nested loops.  The remaining parts of the code have a lower time complexity.
* **Space Complexity:** O(n²), primarily due to the `map` adjacency matrix used to store shortest path distances between all pairs of cities.  The space used by other variables is negligible compared to the matrix.


In summary, this solution efficiently solves the problem using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to pre-compute all-pairs shortest paths, followed by a linear scan to find the city meeting the specified criteria. The cubic time complexity is inherent to the all-pairs shortest path problem, and the quadratic space complexity is necessary to store the distance matrix.  For large numbers of cities, more sophisticated techniques might be needed to optimize space usage, but for problems within LeetCode's typical constraints, this solution provides a clear and relatively efficient approach.
