## LeetCode: Minimum Path Sum - Detailed Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The "Minimum Path Sum" problem asks us to find the minimum sum of values along a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a given rectangular grid.  We can only move down or right at each step.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution employs dynamic programming.  Dynamic programming is ideal here because the problem exhibits optimal substructure (the optimal solution to the main problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to its subproblems) and overlapping subproblems (the same subproblems are solved multiple times in a naive recursive approach).

The core idea is to build a DP table (`dp`) where `dp[i][j]` stores the minimum path sum to reach cell `(i, j)`.  We iterate through the grid, and for each cell, we calculate the minimum path sum by taking the minimum of the path sums from the cell above (`dp[i-1][j]`) and the cell to the left (`dp[i][j-1]`), and adding the current cell's value (`grid[i][j]`).  The base case is `dp[0][0] = grid[0][0]`. Finally, `dp[n-1][m-1]` will contain the minimum path sum to reach the bottom-right corner.  Using `Integer.MAX_VALUE` handles edge cases where we are on the first row or column.

This approach avoids redundant calculations by storing and reusing the minimum path sums to previously visited cells.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:** A 2D array (`int[][]`) is used to store the DP table, mirroring the input grid.
* **Algorithms:** Dynamic programming is the core algorithm used.  The solution iterates through the grid in a nested loop, utilizing a bottom-up approach.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

```java
class Solution {
    public int minPathSum(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length; // Number of rows
        int m = grid[0].length; // Number of columns

        int[][] dp = new int[n][m]; // Initialize the DP table
        dp[0][0] = grid[0][0]; // Base case: minimum path sum to reach (0,0) is just the value at (0,0)

        for(int i = 0; i<n; i++) { // Iterate through rows
            for(int j = 0; j<m; j++) { // Iterate through columns
                if( i == 0 && j == 0) continue; // Skip the top-left cell (already handled)
                int val1 = (i-1 >= 0)?dp[i-1][j]:Integer.MAX_VALUE; // Minimum path sum from above
                int val2 = (j-1 >= 0)?dp[i][j-1]:Integer.MAX_VALUE; // Minimum path sum from left
                dp[i][j] = Math.min(val1, val2)+grid[i][j]; // Update DP table with minimum path sum to current cell
            }
        }

        return dp[n-1][m-1]; // Minimum path sum to reach the bottom-right cell
    }
}
```

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(n*m), where 'n' is the number of rows and 'm' is the number of columns in the grid.  This is because we iterate through the grid once to populate the DP table.

* **Space Complexity:** O(n*m).  The space complexity is dominated by the DP table, which has dimensions n x m.  We could optimize this to O(min(n,m)) using a 1D array if we process rows or columns iteratively, but that would make the code a bit more complex.


**Potential Improvements:**

While the provided code is efficient, a minor optimization could involve avoiding the `if (i == 0 && j == 0) continue;` check by starting the outer loop from `i = 1` and the inner loop from `j = 1`.  This reduces a very small number of operations per iteration, which wouldn't change the asymptotic time complexity but might yield a slight improvement in real-world execution time.  However, for readability and clarity, the original code is perfectly acceptable.
