## Find a Peak Element II - Detailed Explanation

Here's a breakdown of the Java code provided for solving the "Find a Peak Element II" problem on LeetCode.

### 1. Problem Understanding

The problem asks us to find a peak element in a 2D matrix (`mat`). A peak element is defined as an element that is strictly greater than all of its adjacent neighbors (top, bottom, left, and right). We need to return the row and column indices of any peak element within the matrix.  It's guaranteed that the matrix has at least one peak element.

### 2. Approach / Intuition

The core idea behind this solution is to use **binary search on the columns** of the matrix. Here's the reasoning:

1.  **Binary Search on Columns:**  We perform a binary search on the column indices to efficiently narrow down the search space.

2.  **Finding the Maximum Element in Each Column:** For a given column `m` (the middle column in the current binary search range), we find the row index `row` that contains the largest element in that column (`mat[row][m]`).

3.  **Checking if `mat[row][m]` is a Peak:** We then check if `mat[row][m]` is a peak element.  To do this, we compare it to its left neighbor (`mat[row][m-1]`) and its right neighbor (`mat[row][m+1]`). Notice that we only need to check the *horizontal* neighbors because we *already* know that `mat[row][m]` is the largest element *within* its column.

4.  **Adjusting the Binary Search Range:**
    *   If `mat[row][m]` *is* a peak (greater than both left and right neighbors), we've found our answer, and we return its indices.
    *   If `mat[row][m]` is *smaller* than its left neighbor (`mat[row][m-1]`), it means there must be a peak element somewhere to the *left* of column `m` (since we know that at least one peak exists). Therefore, we update the right boundary (`r`) of the binary search to `m - 1`.
    *   If `mat[row][m]` is *smaller* than its right neighbor (`mat[row][m+1]`), it means there must be a peak element somewhere to the *right* of column `m`.  We update the left boundary (`l`) of the binary search to `m + 1`.

This approach works because, with each step of the binary search, we eliminate half of the columns from consideration, ensuring that a peak element exists in the remaining columns. Because we always move towards a larger neighboring element, it is guaranteed that we'll eventually encounter a peak.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms

*   **Data Structures:** The primary data structure used is the 2D array `mat` itself. We also use a simple integer array `ans` of size 2 to store the row and column indices of the peak element.
*   **Algorithms:**
    *   **Binary Search:** This is the core algorithm that efficiently reduces the search space.
    *   **Linear Search (within a column):**  We perform a linear search within the column `m` to find the row containing the maximum element in that column.

### 4. Code Walkthrough

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] findPeakGrid(int[][] mat) {
        int l = 0; // Left boundary of the binary search (column index)
        int r = mat[0].length-1; // Right boundary of the binary search (column index)
        int[] ans = {-1,-1}; // Initialize the answer array with default values

        while(l<=r) // Binary search loop
        {
            int m = (l+r)/2; // Calculate the middle column index
            int row = 0; // Start from the first row
            for(int i = 1 ; i<mat.length ; i++)
                if(mat[row][m]<mat[i][m])
                    row = i; // Find the row with the largest element in column 'm'

            int le = (m>0)?mat[row][m-1]:-1; // Value of the left neighbor, or -1 if no left neighbor
            int ri = (m<mat[0].length-1)?mat[row][m+1]:-1; // Value of the right neighbor, or -1 if no right neighbor

            if(mat[row][m]>le && mat[row][m]>ri) // Check if mat[row][m] is a peak (greater than its neighbors)
            {
                ans[0] = row; // Store the row index
                ans[1] = m; // Store the column index
                break; // Exit the loop since we found a peak
            }
            else if(mat[row][m] < le) // If mat[row][m] is smaller than its left neighbor
                r = m-1; // Search in the left half
            else
                l = m+1; // If mat[row][m] is smaller than its right neighbor (or equal to left), search in the right half
        }
        return ans; // Return the coordinates of the peak element
    }
}
```

*   **`findPeakGrid(int[][] mat)`:** This is the main function that takes the 2D matrix as input.
*   **`l = 0; r = mat[0].length - 1;`**: Initializes the left and right pointers for binary search on the columns.
*   **`int[] ans = {-1, -1};`**:  Initializes an array `ans` to store the result (row and column indices).  It's initialized with `-1` to indicate that a peak hasn't been found yet.
*   **`while (l <= r)`**:  The main binary search loop continues as long as the left pointer is less than or equal to the right pointer.
*   **`int m = (l + r) / 2;`**: Calculates the middle column index.
*   **`for (int i = 1; i < mat.length; i++) ...`**: This inner loop iterates through the rows of column `m` to find the row `row` with the maximum element in that column.
*   **`int le = (m > 0) ? mat[row][m - 1] : -1;`**:  Gets the value of the left neighbor. The ternary operator handles the edge case where the element is in the first column (no left neighbor). In that case, `le` is set to `-1`.
*   **`int ri = (m < mat[0].length - 1) ? mat[row][m + 1] : -1;`**: Gets the value of the right neighbor.  The ternary operator handles the edge case where the element is in the last column (no right neighbor).  In that case, `ri` is set to `-1`.
*   **`if (mat[row][m] > le && mat[row][m] > ri)`**: This condition checks if `mat[row][m]` is a peak element (greater than both its left and right neighbors).  If it is, the indices are stored in `ans`, and the loop breaks.
*   **`else if (mat[row][m] < le)`**: If `mat[row][m]` is less than its left neighbor, the peak element must be to the left.  Therefore, we move the right boundary of the binary search.
*   **`else`**: Otherwise, the peak element must be to the right, and we move the left boundary.
*   **`return ans;`**: Returns the array containing the row and column indices of the peak element.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n log m), where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns. The binary search on the columns takes O(log m) time, and for each column, we iterate through all rows to find the maximum element, which takes O(n) time.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1).  The solution uses a constant amount of extra space for variables like `l`, `r`, `m`, `row`, and the `ans` array.  It doesn't use any auxiliary data structures that scale with the input size.
