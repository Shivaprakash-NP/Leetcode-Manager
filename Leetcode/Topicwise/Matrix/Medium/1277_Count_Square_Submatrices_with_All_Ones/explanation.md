## LeetCode: Count Square Submatrices with All Ones - Detailed Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the total number of square submatrices within a given matrix that contain only 1s.  A square submatrix is a square-shaped section of the matrix.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution employs dynamic programming (DP) to efficiently count the square submatrices.  A brute-force approach would check every possible submatrix, leading to a high time complexity.  DP optimizes this by building upon previously computed results.

The core idea is that if we find a `1` at `matrix[i][j]`, the size of the largest square ending at that position is 1 plus the minimum size of the largest squares ending at `matrix[i-1][j]`, `matrix[i][j-1]`, and `matrix[i-1][j-1]`. This is because to extend a square, all three adjacent squares must also be part of a square submatrix.  If any of these adjacent squares is 0 or doesn't exist (because we're at the edge of the matrix), the size is limited by the size of those squares or defaults to 1 for an isolated '1'.

This approach is chosen because it reduces redundant calculations.  Instead of repeatedly checking submatrices, we build a DP table that stores the size of the largest square ending at each cell, enabling efficient calculation of the total count.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:** A 2D array (`dp`) is used to store the results of the dynamic programming calculation.  The input is also a 2D array (`matrix`).
* **Algorithms:** Dynamic programming is the core algorithm.  The solution iterates through the matrix using nested loops.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

```java
class Solution {
    public int countSquares(int[][] matrix) {
        int n = matrix.length;
        int m = matrix[0].length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n][m];

        // Initialize the first row and column of dp with the values from the matrix.
        for(int i = 0; i<m; i++) dp[0][i] = matrix[0][i];
        for(int i = 0; i<n; i++) dp[i][0] = matrix[i][0];

        // Iterate through the matrix to fill the dp table
        for(int i = 1; i<n; i++) {
            for(int j = 1; j<m; j++) {
                // if the current cell is 1, then calculate the size of the largest square ending at this cell using DP
                if(matrix[i][j] == 1) dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j-1], Math.min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-1]))+1;
            }
        }

        // Sum the values in dp to get the total count of square submatrices
        int ans = 0;
        for(int[] d : dp) for(int v : d) ans+=v;

        return ans;
    }
}
```

* **Initialization:** The first row and column of the `dp` array are initialized directly from the input matrix.  This handles the base cases for the DP calculation.
* **DP Calculation:** The nested loops iterate through the matrix (starting from `[1][1]`). If `matrix[i][j]` is 1,  `dp[i][j]` is calculated as 1 plus the minimum of the three adjacent cells in `dp` (`dp[i-1][j]`, `dp[i][j-1]`, `dp[i-1][j-1]`).  This represents extending the existing squares. If `matrix[i][j]` is 0, `dp[i][j]` implicitly remains 0.
* **Summation:** Finally, the code iterates through the `dp` array, summing up all the values. This sum represents the total count of square submatrices with all ones.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(n*m), where 'n' and 'm' are the dimensions of the input matrix. This is because we iterate through the matrix twice: once for initialization and once for the DP calculation.  The summation step also takes O(n*m).
* **Space Complexity:** O(n*m). This is due to the use of the `dp` array, which has the same dimensions as the input matrix.

The algorithm's efficiency comes from the dynamic programming approach, which avoids redundant calculations.  A brute-force method would have a much higher time complexity (likely O(n³m³)).
