## LeetCode: Making A Large Island - Detailed Solution Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the size of the largest island (connected group of 1s) in a given binary grid.  We can also create a new island by flipping a single 0 to a 1.  The goal is to find the maximum size of an island, considering both existing islands and the potential for creating a new one by changing a single 0.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

This solution uses Union-Find to efficiently identify connected components (islands) in the grid.  The core idea is:

1. **Island Identification:** First, we iterate through the grid and use Union-Find to merge adjacent 1s into groups, tracking the size of each group.  This efficiently finds all the existing islands.

2. **Potential Island Expansion:**  Next, we iterate through the grid again, focusing on cells containing 0s. For each 0, we check its adjacent cells. If adjacent cells belong to different islands, we effectively calculate the size of a potential new island formed by changing that 0 to a 1. This involves summing the sizes of the adjacent islands and adding 1 (for the 0 itself).

3. **Maximum Island Size:** We keep track of the maximum island size encountered, considering both existing islands and the potentially expanded islands.

Union-Find was chosen because it efficiently handles merging connected components and tracking their sizes, significantly improving performance compared to brute-force approaches.

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * `par`: A parent array for Union-Find, representing the parent of each cell (node).
    * `size`: An array storing the size of each connected component in the Union-Find structure.
    * `vis`: A boolean array to mark visited cells during the initial island identification step.
    * `grid`: The input 2D array representing the grid.
    * `HashSet`: Used to avoid duplicate counting of islands when expanding from a 0.
* **Algorithms:**
    * **Union-Find:** Used to efficiently group connected 1s and track island sizes.
    * **Depth-First Search (DFS) (implied):** The logic implicitly uses DFS-like exploration to find connected components in the Union-Find portion.
    * **Greedy Approach:** The solution iterates through all 0s and finds the largest possible island by considering the union of adjacent islands.

**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **Initialization:** The code initializes the `par` and `size` arrays for Union-Find, setting each cell's parent to itself and its size to 1.  It also initializes a `vis` array to track visited cells.

* **Island Identification:** The nested loops iterate through the grid. If a cell contains 1 and hasn't been visited, it performs a depth-first search (implicitly through the `union` function calls) to find all connected 1s and merges them into a single connected component using the `union` function. `vis` prevents revisiting already processed cells.

* **Maximum Existing Island Size:** After identifying all islands, the code finds the largest existing island size using a simple loop.

* **Potential Island Expansion:** The code iterates through the grid again, this time focusing on 0s. For each 0, it finds its adjacent 1s, determines the unique connected components (islands) they belong to using `find`, and sums their sizes to compute the potential size of a new island if the 0 were changed to 1.  The `HashSet` ensures each island's size is counted only once.

* **Final Result:** The code updates `ans` to track the maximum island size, considering both existing and potentially expanded islands.

* **`find` function:** This is the standard find operation for Union-Find, performing path compression for efficiency.

* **`union` function:** This is the standard union operation for Union-Find, merging two components and updating their sizes.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(N*M), where N and M are the dimensions of the grid.  The nested loops iterate through the grid twice. The `find` and `union` operations in Union-Find are amortized O(1) due to path compression.  The HashSet operations are O(1) on average.

* **Space Complexity:** O(N*M) to store the `par`, `size`, and `vis` arrays. The HashSet's space complexity is at most O(N*M) in the worst case (many small islands).

The space complexity is dominated by the arrays that are the same size as the input grid.  The algorithm's efficiency stems from the use of Union-Find, which avoids redundant computations.
