## Sudoku Solver Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The Sudoku Solver problem requires us to write a function that takes a partially filled 9x9 Sudoku board and fills in the empty cells (represented by '.') such that the following rules are satisfied:

1.  Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
2.  Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
3.  Each of the nine 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

The provided Sudoku board is guaranteed to have a unique solution.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The solution employs a backtracking algorithm to explore possible solutions.  Backtracking is a form of depth-first search. The core idea is:

1.  **Find an empty cell:**  Iterate through the board and find an empty cell (represented by a '.').
2.  **Try each digit:** For each empty cell, try placing digits from 1 to 9.
3.  **Check validity:** Before placing a digit, check if placing it violates the Sudoku rules (row, column, and 3x3 box constraints).
4.  **Recurse:** If placing the digit is valid, recursively call the solver on the updated board.
5.  **Backtrack:** If the recursive call doesn't lead to a solution (i.e., the placement was a dead end), undo the placement (set the cell back to '.') and try the next digit.

The algorithm continues until all empty cells are filled with valid digits, satisfying all Sudoku rules.  If no valid digit can be placed in an empty cell, it means the current path is incorrect, and the algorithm backtracks to explore alternative possibilities.

This approach is chosen because Sudoku solving is inherently a constraint satisfaction problem. Backtracking allows us to systematically explore the search space, pruning branches that violate the constraints.  The use of auxiliary data structures (`rows`, `columns`, `boxes`) makes constraint checking efficient.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `board`:  A 2D char array representing the Sudoku board.
    *   `rows`: A 2D integer array (`int[N][N+1]`). `rows[i][d]` stores the count of digit `d` in row `i`.  A value of 1 indicates the digit is present, 0 indicates absent.
    *   `columns`: A 2D integer array (`int[N][N+1]`). `columns[j][d]` stores the count of digit `d` in column `j`. A value of 1 indicates the digit is present, 0 indicates absent.
    *   `boxes`: A 2D integer array (`int[N][N+1]`). `boxes[k][d]` stores the count of digit `d` in the k-th 3x3 box. The boxes are indexed from left to right, top to bottom (0 to 8). A value of 1 indicates the digit is present, 0 indicates absent.

*   **Algorithms:**
    *   **Backtracking:** The core algorithm used to explore the search space.
    *   **Depth-First Search (DFS):**  Backtracking is a type of DFS.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    int n = 3;
    int N = n * n;
    int[][] rows = new int[N][N + 1];
    int[][] columns = new int[N][N + 1];
    int[][] boxes = new int[N][N + 1];
    char[][] board;
    boolean sudokuSolved = false;

    // Checks if placing digit 'd' at (row, col) is valid
    public boolean couldPlace(int d, int row, int col) {
        int idx = (row / n) * n + col / n; // Calculate the box index.
        return rows[row][d] + columns[col][d] + boxes[idx][d] == 0; // Check if 'd' is already present in the row, column, or box.
    }

    // Places the digit 'd' at (row, col) and updates the row, column, and box counts.
    public void placeNumber(int d, int row, int col) {
        int idx = (row / n) * n + col / n; // Calculate the box index.
        rows[row][d]++;          // Increment the count of digit 'd' in the row.
        columns[col][d]++;       // Increment the count of digit 'd' in the column.
        boxes[idx][d]++;         // Increment the count of digit 'd' in the box.
        board[row][col] = (char)(d + '0'); // Place the digit on the board.
    }

    // Removes the digit 'd' from (row, col) and updates the row, column, and box counts.
    public void removeNumber(int d, int row, int col) {
        int idx = (row / n) * n + col / n; // Calculate the box index.
        rows[row][d]--;         // Decrement the count of digit 'd' in the row.
        columns[col][d]--;      // Decrement the count of digit 'd' in the column.
        boxes[idx][d]--;        // Decrement the count of digit 'd' in the box.
        board[row][col] = '.';   // Remove the digit from the board.
    }

    // Moves to the next cell to fill.
    public void placeNextNumbers(int row, int col) {
        if (row == N - 1 && col == N - 1) sudokuSolved = true; // Base case: Sudoku is solved.
        else if (col == N - 1) backtrack(row + 1, 0);   // Move to the next row if the current column is the last column.
        else backtrack(row, col + 1);             // Move to the next column.
    }

    // Backtracking function.
    public void backtrack(int row, int col) {
        if (board[row][col] == '.') {  // If the current cell is empty.
            for (int d = 1; d <= 9; d++) { // Try placing digits from 1 to 9.
                if (couldPlace(d, row, col)) { // If placing digit 'd' is valid.
                    placeNumber(d, row, col);   // Place the digit.
                    placeNextNumbers(row, col); // Move to the next cell.
                    if (!sudokuSolved) removeNumber(d, row, col); // If placing the digit didn't lead to a solution, backtrack (remove the digit).
                }
            }
        } else placeNextNumbers(row, col); // If the current cell is not empty, move to the next cell.
    }

    // Main function to solve the Sudoku.
    public void solveSudoku(char[][] board) {
        this.board = board;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
            for (int j = 0; j < N; j++)
                if (board[i][j] != '.') placeNumber(Character.getNumericValue(board[i][j]), i, j); // Pre-populate the row, column, and box counts based on the initial board state.
        backtrack(0, 0); // Start the backtracking process from the top-left cell.
    }
}
```

*   **`n` and `N`**: These variables define the size of the Sudoku grid (3x3 subgrids and 9x9 total grid).
*   **`rows`, `columns`, `boxes`**: These 2D arrays are used to keep track of the numbers present in each row, column, and 3x3 box.  They are initialized in the class.
*   **`board`**: This stores the actual Sudoku board that will be modified.
*   **`sudokuSolved`**: A flag to indicate when the Sudoku is solved, which helps optimize the backtracking process.
*   **`couldPlace(int d, int row, int col)`**: This method checks if it is valid to place the digit `d` at the given `row` and `col`. It checks for the presence of the same digit in the row, column, and 3x3 box.
*   **`placeNumber(int d, int row, int col)`**: This method places the digit `d` at the specified position (`row`, `col`) on the `board` and updates the `rows`, `columns`, and `boxes` arrays accordingly.
*   **`removeNumber(int d, int row, int col)`**: This method removes the digit `d` from the specified position and updates the auxiliary arrays. It's crucial for backtracking.
*   **`placeNextNumbers(int row, int col)`**: This is a helper function that determines the next cell to be filled.  If the current cell is the last cell in the grid, it sets `sudokuSolved` to `true`. Otherwise, it moves to the next cell in a row-major order.
*   **`backtrack(int row, int col)`**: This is the core backtracking function.  It first checks if the current cell is empty. If it is, it tries placing digits from 1 to 9.  For each digit, it checks if placing the digit is valid using `couldPlace()`. If it's valid, it places the digit, recursively calls `placeNextNumbers()` to move to the next cell. If `sudokuSolved` becomes true during the recursive calls, it means a solution is found and the backtracking process stops.  If the recursive calls don't lead to a solution (indicated by `!sudokuSolved`), it means the placement was a dead end, and the digit is removed using `removeNumber()` to try the next digit. If the current cell is not empty, it simply moves on to the next cell by calling `placeNextNumbers()`.
*   **`solveSudoku(char[][] board)`**: This is the main function that initiates the Sudoku solving process.  It first copies the input `board` to the instance variable.  Then, it iterates through the initial board and populates the `rows`, `columns`, and `boxes` arrays with the existing numbers. Finally, it calls the `backtrack()` function to start the recursive solving process, starting from the cell (0, 0).

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:**  The worst-case time complexity is difficult to pin down precisely because it depends on the initial state of the board. In the worst case, it can be O(9<sup>m</sup>), where 'm' is the number of empty cells. However, in practice, the constraints significantly prune the search space, so the actual runtime is often much better. This is still exponential.

*   **Space Complexity:** O(N<sup>2</sup>), where N = 9.  This is due to the `rows`, `columns`, and `boxes` arrays, each of size N x (N+1), and the recursive call stack in the `backtrack` method can also grow in depth. The size of the board itself is constant.
