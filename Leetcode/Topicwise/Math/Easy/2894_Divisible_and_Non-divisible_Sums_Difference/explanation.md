## Divisible and Non-divisible Sums Difference - Solution Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to calculate the difference between the sum of all numbers from 1 to `n` that are *not* divisible by `m` and the sum of all numbers from 1 to `n` that *are* divisible by `m`.  In other words, we need to compute `sum(numbers not divisible by m) - sum(numbers divisible by m)`.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The most straightforward approach is to iterate through all numbers from 1 to `n`. For each number `i`, we check if it is divisible by `m` using the modulo operator (`%`). If `i % m == 0`, it means `i` is divisible by `m`, and we subtract it from the running total `ans`. Otherwise, `i` is not divisible by `m`, and we add it to `ans`.  This method avoids storing separate lists or performing complex calculations. It directly computes the difference in a single pass.

This approach is chosen for its simplicity and direct translation of the problem statement.  There's no need for more complex data structures or algorithms, as a single loop achieves the desired result efficiently.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:** No explicit data structures (like arrays, lists, or hash maps) are used. Only integer variables are utilized.
*   **Algorithms:** The algorithm used is a simple **iteration** (loop) with a **conditional statement**. We iterate through the numbers and apply a condition to determine whether to add or subtract each number from the running total.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int differenceOfSums(int n, int m) {
        int ans = 0; // Initialize the variable to store the difference of sums.
        for(int i = 1 ; i<=n ; i++) { // Iterate from 1 to n (inclusive).
            if(i%m == 0) ans-=i; // If i is divisible by m (remainder is 0), subtract i from ans.
            else ans+=i; // Otherwise (i is not divisible by m), add i to ans.
        }
        return ans; // Return the calculated difference.
    }
}
```

*   **`class Solution { ... }`**:  This defines a class named `Solution` which is standard in LeetCode submissions.
*   **`public int differenceOfSums(int n, int m) { ... }`**:  This defines the method `differenceOfSums` that takes two integer inputs, `n` and `m`, and returns an integer, which is the calculated difference.
*   **`int ans = 0;`**: This line initializes an integer variable `ans` to 0.  This variable will accumulate the difference between the sums.
*   **`for(int i = 1 ; i<=n ; i++) { ... }`**: This `for` loop iterates from `i = 1` up to and including `n`.  In each iteration, `i` represents a number from the range 1 to `n`.
*   **`if(i%m == 0) ans-=i;`**: This `if` statement checks if `i` is divisible by `m`. The modulo operator `%` returns the remainder of the division `i / m`. If the remainder is 0, it means `i` is divisible by `m`.  If it is, we subtract `i` from `ans`.
*   **`else ans+=i;`**: If the condition `i % m == 0` is false (i.e., `i` is not divisible by `m`), this `else` block is executed.  We add `i` to `ans`.
*   **`return ans;`**: After the loop finishes iterating through all numbers from 1 to `n`, this line returns the final value of `ans`, which represents the calculated difference of sums.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** The code iterates through the numbers from 1 to `n` using a `for` loop. The loop runs `n` times, and inside the loop, the operations (modulo, addition, subtraction) take constant time. Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**.

*   **Space Complexity:** The code uses only a single integer variable `ans` to store the result and a loop counter `i`.  The amount of memory used does not depend on the input size `n` or `m`. Hence, the space complexity is **O(1)** (constant space).
