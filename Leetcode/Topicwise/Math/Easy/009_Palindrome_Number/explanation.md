## LeetCode Problem: Palindrome Number - Solution Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to determine whether a given integer is a palindrome. A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backward. For example, 121 is a palindrome, while 123 is not. Negative numbers are not considered palindromes.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is to reverse the given integer and then compare the reversed integer with the original integer. If they are the same, the original number is a palindrome.  A crucial optimization is to handle negative numbers and numbers ending with zero. Negative numbers are not palindromes. Numbers ending with zero are only palindromes if the number itself is zero. Reversing the entire number before comparing avoids issues that can arise with integer overflow for very large numbers.

**Why this approach?**

*   **Simplicity:** This approach is relatively straightforward to understand and implement.
*   **Efficiency:**  Reversing the integer can be done in a loop with basic arithmetic operations, making it efficient in terms of time complexity.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:**  The solution primarily uses primitive data types like `int` and `boolean`. No complex data structures are needed.
*   **Algorithms:**  The key algorithm used is integer reversal.  This involves extracting digits from the original number and constructing the reversed number digit-by-digit.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        boolean bool = false; // Initialize a boolean variable to store the result. Default to false.
        int temp = x;       // Store the original number in 'temp' for later comparison.
        int s = 0;          // Initialize 's' to 0. This will store the reversed number.

        while (x>0)         // Iterate as long as the number 'x' is positive. We exclude negative numbers and stop when the number becomes 0.
        {
            int d = x%10;     // Extract the last digit of 'x' using the modulo operator (%).
            s = s*10+d;     // Build the reversed number 's' by multiplying it by 10 and adding the extracted digit 'd'. This effectively shifts the existing digits in 's' to the left and adds the new digit at the ones place.
            x/=10;          // Remove the last digit from 'x' by integer division (/).
        }

        if(temp==s) bool = true; // Compare the original number 'temp' with the reversed number 's'. If they are equal, set 'bool' to true, indicating that the number is a palindrome.

        return bool;        // Return the boolean result.
    }
}
```

**Detailed Explanation:**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   `boolean bool = false;`: A boolean variable `bool` is initialized to `false`. This variable will store whether the number is a palindrome.
    *   `int temp = x;`:  The original input integer `x` is stored in the `temp` variable. This is important because the value of `x` will change during the reversal process. We need to keep the original value for comparison later.
    *   `int s = 0;`: An integer variable `s` is initialized to 0. This variable will store the reversed number as it's constructed.

2.  **Reversal Loop:**
    *   `while (x > 0)`: The `while` loop continues as long as `x` is greater than 0.  This condition correctly handles positive integers, and the loop terminates when all digits of `x` have been processed. Numbers equal to zero are treated correctly outside of this while loop by the `if` statement that checks for equality of `temp` and `s`. Note that negative numbers are excluded by the `x>0` condition.
    *   `int d = x % 10;`: The modulo operator (`%`) extracts the last digit of `x`.  For example, if `x` is 123, then `d` will be 3.
    *   `s = s * 10 + d;`: This is the core of the reversal logic.  `s` is multiplied by 10, effectively shifting its digits one place to the left. Then, the extracted digit `d` is added to `s`, placing it in the ones place.  For example, if `s` is initially 0 and `d` is 3, then `s` becomes 3.  If `s` is 3 and `d` is 2, then `s` becomes 32.
    *   `x /= 10;`: Integer division (`/=`) removes the last digit from `x`.  For example, if `x` is 123, then `x` becomes 12.

3.  **Palindrome Check:**
    *   `if (temp == s) bool = true;`: After the loop finishes, `s` contains the reversed number. The `if` statement compares the original number `temp` with the reversed number `s`. If they are equal, it means the number is a palindrome, and `bool` is set to `true`.

4.  **Return Value:**
    *   `return bool;`: The function returns the boolean value `bool`, indicating whether the input number is a palindrome.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(log10(x)).  The number of iterations in the `while` loop is proportional to the number of digits in the input number `x`. The number of digits in a number `x` is roughly log base 10 of `x`. Therefore, the time complexity is logarithmic.

*   **Space Complexity:** O(1).  The solution uses a constant amount of extra space to store variables like `temp`, `s`, `d`, and `bool`. The space used does not depend on the size of the input number `x`.
