## LeetCode Problem: Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits - Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to find the number of integers in a given array `nums` that have an even number of digits.  For example, if `nums = [12,345,2,6,7896]`, the answer would be 2 because `12` (2 digits) and `7896` (4 digits) have an even number of digits.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is straightforward: for each number in the input array, we need to count the number of digits it contains and then check if that count is even. If it is, we increment a counter. Finally, we return the counter.

The approach is simple and efficient because:

*   It directly addresses the problem's requirement (counting digits).
*   It avoids complex data structures or algorithms.
*   It has a clear and easily understandable logic.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:** We only use an integer array `nums` as input and integer variables to store the number of digits (`n`) and the final answer (`ans`). No other complex data structures are needed.
*   **Algorithms:** The core algorithm is an iterative digit counting algorithm. We repeatedly divide the number by 10 until it becomes 0, incrementing the digit counter in each iteration. The modulo operator (`%`) is used to check for evenness.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int findNumbers(int[] nums) {
        int ans = 0; // Initialize a counter to store the number of integers with an even number of digits.
        for(int v : nums) { // Iterate through each integer 'v' in the input array 'nums'.  This is an enhanced for loop.
            int n = 0; // Initialize a counter 'n' to store the number of digits for the current integer 'v'.
            while(v != 0) { // Loop until the current integer 'v' becomes 0.
                v/=10; // Integer division by 10 effectively removes the last digit of 'v'.
                n++; // Increment the digit counter 'n' for each digit removed.
            }
            if(n%2 == 0) ans++; // Check if the number of digits 'n' is even. If it is, increment the answer counter 'ans'.
        }
        return ans; // Return the final count of integers with an even number of digits.
    }
}
```

*   **`int ans = 0;`**:  Initializes a variable `ans` to 0. This variable will keep track of the number of elements in `nums` that have an even number of digits.
*   **`for(int v : nums)`**: This enhanced for loop iterates through each element `v` in the input array `nums`.
*   **`int n = 0;`**:  For each number `v`, we initialize a counter `n` to 0. This variable will count the number of digits in the current number `v`.
*   **`while(v != 0)`**:  This `while` loop is the core of the digit counting logic. It continues as long as the number `v` is not zero.
*   **`v/=10;`**: Inside the loop, `v /= 10` performs integer division, effectively removing the rightmost digit of `v`. For example, if `v` is 123, `v /= 10` will make `v` equal to 12.
*   **`n++;`**: Each time we remove a digit, we increment the digit counter `n`.
*   **`if(n%2 == 0) ans++;`**: After the `while` loop finishes (meaning we've processed all digits of `v`), we check if the digit count `n` is even using the modulo operator (`%`). If `n % 2` is 0, it means `n` is even, and we increment the answer counter `ans`.
*   **`return ans;`**: Finally, we return the value of `ans`, which is the total number of integers in `nums` that have an even number of digits.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(N * D), where N is the number of elements in the input array `nums`, and D is the average number of digits in each element. For each number in `nums`, the `while` loop iterates a number of times proportional to the number of digits.  In the worst-case scenario (all numbers have the maximum possible number of digits), D is constant (close to log10(Integer.MAX_VALUE)). Thus, on average, D can be considered constant with an upper bound. So the algorithm can be simplified to O(N).
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1). The algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space for the `ans` and `n` variables, regardless of the input size.  No additional data structures scale with the size of `nums`.
