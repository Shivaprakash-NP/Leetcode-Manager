## LeetCode Problem: Find Closest Person - Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem "Find Closest Person" (although the exact problem statement isn't provided, we can infer it based on the code) asks us to determine which of two people, located at positions `x` and `y`, is closer to a third person located at position `z`. The function needs to return:

*   `0` if the distances from `z` to `x` and `z` to `y` are equal.
*   `1` if `x` is closer to `z` than `y`.
*   `2` if `y` is closer to `z` than `x`.

Essentially, we're comparing the absolute differences between `z` and `x`, and `z` and `y` to determine relative proximity.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The approach is straightforward and directly reflects the problem requirements. We calculate the absolute distance between person `x` and person `z` and the absolute distance between person `y` and person `z`.  We then compare these two distances:

*   If they are equal, it implies that both `x` and `y` are equidistant from `z`, so we return `0`.
*   If the distance between `x` and `z` is smaller than the distance between `y` and `z`, it means `x` is closer, and we return `1`.
*   Otherwise (if the distance between `y` and `z` is smaller), it means `y` is closer, and we return `2`.

This approach is chosen for its simplicity and efficiency.  It directly addresses the comparison requirement without the need for more complex algorithms or data structures.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:** No complex data structures are used. We are only dealing with primitive integer values.
*   **Algorithms:**  The core algorithm is based on calculating the absolute difference (using `Math.abs()`) and performing simple conditional comparisons (using `if-else if-else`).

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int findClosest(int x, int y, int z) {
        if(Math.abs(z-x) == Math.abs(z-y)) return 0;
        else if(Math.abs(z-x) < Math.abs(z-y)) return 1;
        return 2;
    }
}
```

*   **`class Solution { ... }`**: This defines the class containing the solution method.  LeetCode often uses this structure for problem submissions.
*   **`public int findClosest(int x, int y, int z) { ... }`**: This is the method that implements the logic to find the closest person.  It takes three integer arguments `x`, `y`, and `z` representing the positions of the three people. It returns an integer indicating which person is closest (0, 1, or 2 as defined in the problem).
*   **`if(Math.abs(z-x) == Math.abs(z-y)) return 0;`**: This line calculates the absolute distance between `z` and `x` and between `z` and `y`. If the distances are equal, it means `x` and `y` are equidistant from `z`, so the function returns `0`.
*   **`else if(Math.abs(z-x) < Math.abs(z-y)) return 1;`**: This line checks if the absolute distance between `z` and `x` is less than the absolute distance between `z` and `y`. If it is, it means `x` is closer to `z` than `y`, so the function returns `1`.
*   **`return 2;`**: If neither of the above conditions is met, it means the absolute distance between `z` and `y` is less than the absolute distance between `z` and `x`, implying `y` is closer to `z`. The function returns `2` in this case.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity: O(1)** - The code performs a fixed number of calculations and comparisons, regardless of the input values. The `Math.abs()` function has a constant time complexity. Therefore, the overall time complexity is constant.
*   **Space Complexity: O(1)** - The code uses a fixed amount of extra space to store variables, regardless of the input values. The space used for `x`, `y`, `z` and the return value does not scale with input size, thus the space complexity is constant.
