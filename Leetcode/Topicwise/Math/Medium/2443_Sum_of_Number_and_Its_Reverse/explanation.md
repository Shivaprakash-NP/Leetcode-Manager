## LeetCode Problem: Sum of Number and Its Reverse

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to determine if a given non-negative integer `num` can be expressed as the sum of an integer `i` and its reverse.  In other words, we need to find if there exists an integer `i` (where `0 <= i <= num`) such that `i + reverse(i) == num`.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The solution employs a straightforward brute-force approach.  The intuition is that we can iterate through all possible values of `i` from 1 up to `num`.  For each `i`, we calculate its reverse using a helper function `rev(i)`.  Then, we check if the sum of `i` and its reverse equals the target number `num`. If we find such an `i`, it means the condition is satisfied, and we return `true`. If we iterate through all possible values of `i` and don't find a match, we return `false`.

This approach is chosen because the problem constraints are relatively small, and a brute-force search is sufficient to find a solution within the time limit. There is no need for more complex data structures or algorithms.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:** No specific data structures are used beyond primitive integer types.
*   **Algorithms:**
    *   **Iteration:** The `sumOfNumberAndReverse` function iterates through a range of numbers.
    *   **Reverse Number Calculation:** The `rev` function implements an algorithm to reverse a given integer.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    private int rev(int num) {
        int r = 0;
        while(num > 0) {
            r = r*10+num%10;
            num/=10;
        }
        return r;
    }

    public boolean sumOfNumberAndReverse(int num) {
        if(num == 0) return true;
        for(int i = 1 ; i<=num ; i++) {
            if(i + rev(i) == num) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

*   **`rev(int num)` function:**
    *   This function calculates the reverse of a given integer `num`.
    *   It initializes `r` to 0, which will store the reversed number.
    *   The `while` loop continues as long as `num` is greater than 0.
    *   Inside the loop:
        *   `r = r * 10 + num % 10;`: This line extracts the last digit of `num` using the modulo operator (`% 10`) and appends it to the reversed number `r`. Multiplying `r` by 10 shifts the existing digits to the left, making space for the new digit.
        *   `num /= 10;`: This line removes the last digit from `num` by integer division (`/ 10`).
    *   Finally, the function returns the reversed number `r`.

*   **`sumOfNumberAndReverse(int num)` function:**
    *   This function checks if `num` can be expressed as the sum of an integer and its reverse.
    *   `if(num == 0) return true;`: This handles the base case where `num` is 0. In this case, 0 + reverse(0) == 0, so we return `true`.
    *   `for(int i = 1 ; i<=num ; i++)`: This loop iterates through all possible values of `i` from 1 to `num`.
    *   `if(i + rev(i) == num) return true;`: For each `i`, it calculates `rev(i)` using the helper function and checks if `i + rev(i)` is equal to `num`. If it is, it means we've found a solution, and we return `true`.
    *   `return false;`: If the loop completes without finding a solution, it means no such `i` exists, and we return `false`.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(N * logN), where N is the input number `num`.
    *   The `sumOfNumberAndReverse` function iterates from 1 to `num`, which takes O(N) time.
    *   Inside the loop, the `rev` function is called for each `i`. The `rev` function's complexity is O(logN) because the number of iterations in the `while` loop is proportional to the number of digits in `i`, which is logarithmic with respect to `i` (and therefore also with respect to N, in the worst case).
    *   Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(N * logN).

*   **Space Complexity:** O(1).
    *   The solution uses only a few integer variables, so the space used is constant, regardless of the input value. Therefore, the space complexity is O(1).
