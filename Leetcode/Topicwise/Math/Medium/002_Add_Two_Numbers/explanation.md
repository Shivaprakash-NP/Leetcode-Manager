## Add Two Numbers: Detailed Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The "Add Two Numbers" problem asks us to add two numbers represented as linked lists. Each node in the linked list represents a single digit, and the digits are stored in reverse order.  We need to return a new linked list that represents the sum of these two numbers, also with digits in reverse order.

For example:

Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is to simulate the manual addition process we learned in elementary school. We iterate through both linked lists simultaneously, adding the digits at the corresponding positions along with any carry-over from the previous digit. We keep track of the carry and append the resulting digit (sum % 10) to a new linked list.  The process continues until both linked lists are exhausted, and there's no carry-over left.

Why this approach?

*   **Direct Simulation:** It mirrors the fundamental way we add numbers, making the logic straightforward.
*   **Linked List Friendly:**  Linked lists are ideal for building the result incrementally, one digit at a time.  We don't need to know the final size in advance.
*   **Reverse Order Advantage:** The digits being in reverse order simplifies the addition process as we can start from the least significant digit directly.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Linked List:** The problem revolves around linked lists. We use `ListNode` to represent each digit and its connection to the next digit.
*   **Iteration/Looping:** The `while` loop is essential for iterating through the linked lists and performing the digit-by-digit addition.
*   **Basic Arithmetic Operations:**  We use addition (`+`), modulo (`%`), and integer division (`/`) for calculating the sum and carry.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode addTwoNumbers(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
        ListNode ans = new ListNode(0); // Create a dummy head node for the result list.
        ListNode ret = ans; // Store the reference to the head to return later.
        int c = 0; // Initialize the carry to 0.

        while(l1 != null || l2 != null || c!=0) // Iterate until both lists are exhausted and there's no carry.
        {
            int sum = c; // Initialize the sum with the carry from the previous digit.

            if(l1 != null) // If the first list has a digit at the current position
            {
                sum+=l1.val; // Add the digit's value to the sum.
                l1 = l1.next; // Move to the next digit in the first list.
            }

            if(l2 != null) // If the second list has a digit at the current position
            {
                sum+=l2.val; // Add the digit's value to the sum.
                l2 = l2.next; // Move to the next digit in the second list.
            }

            ans.next = new ListNode(sum%10); // Create a new node with the last digit of the sum and append it to the result list.  `sum % 10` gives the units digit.
            c = sum/10; // Calculate the carry for the next digit. `sum / 10` gives the tens digit.
            ans = ans.next; // Move the `ans` pointer to the newly created node, preparing for the next digit.
        }

        return ret.next; // Return the result list, skipping the dummy head node.
    }
}
```

**Detailed Breakdown:**

1.  **`ListNode ans = new ListNode(0);`**: A dummy head node (`ans`) is created. This simplifies the code by avoiding special case handling for the first digit. The value is initialized to 0, which doesn't affect the sum.

2.  **`ListNode ret = ans;`**:  The `ret` variable stores the original reference to the dummy head. We'll need this later to return the actual result.

3.  **`int c = 0;`**: `c` represents the carry-over from the previous digit addition. It's initialized to 0.

4.  **`while(l1 != null || l2 != null || c!=0)`**: This loop continues as long as there are digits to process in either list (`l1 != null` or `l2 != null`) or there's a carry-over from the previous digit (`c != 0`).  This ensures that we process all digits and any potential remaining carry.

5.  **`int sum = c;`**:  The `sum` variable is initialized with the carry from the previous addition.

6.  **`if(l1 != null) { ... }`**: If there are more digits in `l1`, add the value of the current digit to the `sum` and move to the next digit (`l1 = l1.next`).

7.  **`if(l2 != null) { ... }`**:  Similar to the previous `if` block, if there are more digits in `l2`, add the value of the current digit to the `sum` and move to the next digit (`l2 = l2.next`).

8.  **`ans.next = new ListNode(sum%10);`**:  A new node is created with the value `sum % 10`. This extracts the least significant digit (units digit) of the sum, which will be the value of the current digit in the result list.  This new node is then linked to the current tail of the result list (`ans.next`).

9.  **`c = sum/10;`**:  The carry is calculated by taking the integer division of the `sum` by 10. This extracts the tens digit, which represents the carry-over to the next position.

10. **`ans = ans.next;`**:  The `ans` pointer is moved to the newly added node. This makes the new node the current tail of the result list, ready to append the next digit.

11. **`return ret.next;`**: Finally, the `next` of the original dummy head (`ret.next`) is returned. This skips the dummy head and returns the actual result list.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity: O(max(m, n))**, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the two linked lists, respectively.  In the worst case, we need to iterate through the longer list.
*   **Space Complexity: O(max(m, n))**.  In the worst case, the resulting linked list will have a length of `max(m, n) + 1` (due to the potential carry). So, the space used by the new linked list dominates the space complexity.
