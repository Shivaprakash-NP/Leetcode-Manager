## Rotate Array Problem Explanation

Here's a detailed explanation of the provided Java code for the LeetCode "Rotate Array" problem.

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The "Rotate Array" problem asks us to rotate the elements of an array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is a non-negative integer.  This means moving the last `k` elements of the array to the beginning and shifting the remaining elements to the right. For example, if `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` and `k = 3`, the rotated array should be `[5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The solution employs a clever approach based on reversing array segments.  The core idea is to:

1.  **Reverse the entire array:** This puts the last `k` elements at the beginning (in reverse order) and the first `n-k` elements at the end (also in reverse order).

2.  **Reverse the first `k` elements:** This corrects the order of the elements that were originally at the end of the array.

3.  **Reverse the remaining `n-k` elements:** This corrects the order of the elements that were originally at the beginning of the array.

Why this approach?  Reversing segments is an efficient in-place operation, meaning it modifies the original array directly without requiring extra space proportional to the input size. It provides a clean and relatively easy-to-understand solution.  Other approaches like iteratively shifting elements one by one would have a much higher time complexity.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:** The primary data structure is an `int[]`, a simple integer array.
*   **Algorithms:** The key algorithm used is **reversal**.  The `reverse` helper function implements the standard in-place array reversal algorithm using two pointers.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public void reverse(int[] arr , int left , int right) {
        while (left < right) {
            int temp = arr[left];
            arr[left] = arr[right];
            arr[right] = temp;
            left++;
            right--;
        }
    }

    public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.length;
        k = k % n;
        reverse(nums, 0, n - 1);
        reverse(nums, 0, k - 1);
        reverse(nums, k, n - 1);
    }
}
```

*   **`reverse(int[] arr, int left, int right)` Function:**
    *   This helper function reverses the portion of the array `arr` between indices `left` and `right` (inclusive).
    *   It uses a `while` loop that continues as long as `left` is less than `right`.
    *   Inside the loop:
        *   `int temp = arr[left];`:  Stores the element at the `left` index in a temporary variable `temp`.
        *   `arr[left] = arr[right];`: Replaces the element at the `left` index with the element at the `right` index.
        *   `arr[right] = temp;`: Replaces the element at the `right` index with the value stored in `temp` (the original value at the `left` index).
        *   `left++;`: Increments the `left` pointer to move towards the right.
        *   `right--;`: Decrements the `right` pointer to move towards the left.

*   **`rotate(int[] nums, int k)` Function:**
    *   `int n = nums.length;`: Gets the length of the input array `nums`.
    *   `k = k % n;`:  Calculates the effective rotation value. This handles cases where `k` is larger than the array length. Taking the modulo ensures that `k` is within the range `0` to `n-1`.  For example, rotating by `n` is the same as not rotating at all.  Rotating by `n+1` is the same as rotating by `1`.
    *   `reverse(nums, 0, n - 1);`: Reverses the entire array.
    *   `reverse(nums, 0, k - 1);`: Reverses the first `k` elements of the array.
    *   `reverse(nums, k, n - 1);`: Reverses the remaining `n-k` elements of the array.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the array.  The `reverse` function iterates through a portion of the array, and it's called three times.  Since each call to `reverse` takes at most O(n) time, the overall time complexity is O(n) + O(k) + O(n-k) which simplifies to O(n).

*   **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is **O(1)**, or constant space. The algorithm operates in place, meaning it modifies the original array directly without using any additional data structures that scale with the input size. The `reverse` function uses only a single temporary variable `temp`, which contributes to the constant space complexity.
