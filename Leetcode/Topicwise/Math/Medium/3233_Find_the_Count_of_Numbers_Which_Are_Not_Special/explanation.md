## LeetCode Problem: Find the Count of Numbers Which Are Not Special

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem defines a "special" number as a perfect square whose square root is a prime number. Given a range [l, r], the goal is to count the number of integers within that range that are *not* "special."

In simpler terms: We need to find all numbers in the range [l, r] and subtract the count of "special" numbers in the same range from the total numbers in the range to arrive at the answer. A "special" number is the square of a prime number.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The most straightforward approach is to iterate through the range [l, r] and check each number to see if it's "special."  However, this would be inefficient, especially for large ranges. A more efficient method involves generating all possible "special" numbers within the range and then counting them.

The logic behind this is as follows:

1.  **Identify Potential Square Roots:**  Since we are looking for numbers that are squares of primes, we can iterate through potential prime numbers.
2.  **Limit the Search Space:** We only need to consider prime numbers whose squares fall within the given range [l, r].  This drastically reduces the search space.  We iterate from `sqrt(l)` to `sqrt(r)`.
3.  **Check for Primality:** For each potential square root (let's call it `i`), we need to determine if it's a prime number. The function `sr(i)` checks this condition.
4.  **Check if Special number in Range:** If `i` is prime, and the square of `i` falls in the range `[l,r]` we increment a counter representing the count of special numbers.
5.  **Calculate the Non-Special Count:**  Finally, the number of non-special numbers is equal to the total numbers in the range [l, r] minus the number of "special" numbers found.

This approach is more efficient because we directly calculate the "special" numbers instead of checking the special property for each number in the range.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Algorithm:** The core algorithm is a modified version of trial division for primality testing, combined with range-based counting.
*   **Data Structures:** No significant data structures are used.  The solution primarily uses primitive data types like integers and booleans.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    private boolean sr(int v) {
        if(v == 1) return false;
        for(int i = 2 ; i*i <= v ; i++) 
            if(v%i == 0) return false;
        return true;
    }

    public int nonSpecialCount(int l, int r) {
        int ans = 0;
        for(int i = (int) Math.sqrt(l) ; i <= (int)Math.sqrt(r) ; i++) {
            if(sr(i) && i*i<=r && i*i>=l) ans++;
        }
        return (r-l+1 - ans);
    }
}
```

*   **`sr(int v)`:**
    *   This function determines if a given integer `v` is a prime number.
    *   `if(v == 1) return false;`: 1 is not a prime number. This is the base condition.
    *   `for(int i = 2 ; i*i <= v ; i++)`: This loop iterates from 2 up to the square root of `v`. If `v` has a divisor greater than its square root, it also has a divisor smaller than its square root. Therefore we only need to check until the square root.
    *   `if(v%i == 0) return false;`: If `v` is divisible by `i`, then `v` is not prime, and the function immediately returns `false`.
    *   `return true;`: If the loop completes without finding any divisors, then `v` is prime, and the function returns `true`.

*   **`nonSpecialCount(int l, int r)`:**
    *   This function calculates the number of non-special numbers in the range [l, r].
    *   `int ans = 0;`: Initializes a variable `ans` to store the count of "special" numbers.
    *   `for(int i = (int) Math.sqrt(l) ; i <= (int)Math.sqrt(r) ; i++)`: This loop iterates through potential prime numbers `i` whose squares could fall within the range [l, r]. We only iterate sqrt(l) to sqrt(r) since a special number `s` in `[l,r]` can be expressed as `s = p^2`, where `p` is a prime.  Thus, `l <= p^2 <= r`, which gives us `sqrt(l) <= p <= sqrt(r)`.
    *   `if(sr(i) && i*i<=r && i*i>=l) ans++;`:
        *   `sr(i)`: This checks if `i` is a prime number using the `sr` function.
        *   `i*i<=r && i*i>=l`: This checks if `i*i` falls within the given range [l, r].
        *   If both conditions are true, then `i*i` is a "special" number, and the counter `ans` is incremented.
    *   `return (r-l+1 - ans);`: This line calculates the number of non-special numbers by subtracting the count of "special" numbers (`ans`) from the total number of integers in the range [l, r] (which is `r - l + 1`).

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:**

    *   `sr(v)`:  The `sr(v)` function iterates up to `sqrt(v)`, giving it a time complexity of O(sqrt(v)).
    *   `nonSpecialCount(l, r)`: The outer loop iterates from `sqrt(l)` to `sqrt(r)`.  Inside this loop, the `sr(i)` function is called. Therefore, the dominant time complexity factor is the outer loop combined with the `sr(i)` call. The overall time complexity can be expressed as O((sqrt(r) - sqrt(l)) * sqrt(sqrt(r))) which is roughly O(r^(1/4) * sqrt(r)). This can be simplified to O(r^(3/4)).

*   **Space Complexity:**

    *   The solution uses only a few integer variables. Therefore, the space complexity is O(1) (constant).
