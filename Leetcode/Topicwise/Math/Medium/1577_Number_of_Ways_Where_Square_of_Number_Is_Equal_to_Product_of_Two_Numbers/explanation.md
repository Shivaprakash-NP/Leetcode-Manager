## LeetCode Problem: Number of Ways Where Square of Number Is Equal to Product of Two Numbers

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to find the number of triplets that satisfy a specific condition. Given two integer arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, we need to find the number of triplets (i, j, k) such that either:

*   `nums1[i]^2 == nums2[j] * nums2[k]`  where `j < k`
*   `nums2[i]^2 == nums1[j] * nums1[k]`  where `j < k`

Essentially, we are looking for cases where the square of a number from one array is equal to the product of two distinct numbers from the other array.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is to precompute the squares of the elements in each array and store them in hash maps. This allows us to efficiently check if a certain square value exists in the other array.

The approach involves the following steps:

1.  **Precompute Squares:** Calculate the square of each number in `nums1` and `nums2` and store them in separate hash maps (`v1` and `v2`, respectively). The keys of the hash maps are the square values, and the values are the frequency of each square value.

2.  **Iterate and Check:**
    *   Iterate through all possible pairs of elements in `nums1` (with indices `i` and `j`, where `i < j`) and compute their product.
    *   Check if this product exists as a key in the `v2` hash map (which contains the squares of elements in `nums2`). If it does, it means that the square of some element in `nums2` is equal to the product of `nums1[i]` and `nums1[j]`. Add the count (frequency) associated with the product to our result `c`.
    *   Repeat the same process, but this time, iterate through pairs in `nums2` and check against `v1`.

**Why this approach?**

*   **Efficiency:**  Using hash maps provides O(1) average time complexity for lookups (checking if a square value or product exists). This is significantly faster than iterating through the entire array each time we need to check for the existence of a value.
*   **Clarity:**  Separating the square precomputation step from the pair-product comparison makes the code more readable and easier to understand.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Hash Maps (`HashMap` in Java):** Used to store the frequency of squares in each array for O(1) average time lookup.
*   **Nested Loops:** Used to iterate through all possible pairs of distinct elements in each array.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numTriplets(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        int c = 0; // Initialize the count of triplets

        // HashMap to store the squares of elements in nums1 and their frequencies
        HashMap<Long, Integer> v1 = new HashMap<>();

        // HashMap to store the squares of elements in nums2 and their frequencies
        HashMap<Long, Integer> v2 = new HashMap<>();

        // Precompute squares for nums1
        for (int i = 0; i < nums1.length; i++) {
            long v = 1L * nums1[i] * nums1[i]; // Calculate the square (use 1L to prevent integer overflow)
            v1.put(v, v1.getOrDefault(v, 0) + 1); // Store the square and its frequency
        }

        // Precompute squares for nums2
        for (int i = 0; i < nums2.length; i++) {
            long v = 1L * nums2[i] * nums2[i]; // Calculate the square (use 1L to prevent integer overflow)
            v2.put(v, v2.getOrDefault(v, 0) + 1); // Store the square and its frequency
        }

        // Iterate through nums1 pairs and check against nums2 squares
        for (int i = 0; i < nums1.length; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < nums1.length; j++) {
                long product = 1L * nums1[i] * nums1[j];  // Calculate the product of the pair
                c += (v2.get(product) == null) ? 0 : (v2.get(product)); // Check if the product exists as a square in nums2, and add the frequency if it does
            }
        }

        // Iterate through nums2 pairs and check against nums1 squares
        for (int i = 0; i < nums2.length; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < nums2.length; j++) {
                long product = 1L * nums2[i] * nums2[j]; // Calculate the product of the pair
                c += (v1.get(product) == null) ? 0 : (v1.get(product)); // Check if the product exists as a square in nums1, and add the frequency if it does
            }
        }

        return c; // Return the total count of triplets
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`numTriplets(int[] nums1, int[] nums2)`:**  The main function that takes two integer arrays as input.
2.  **`int c = 0;`:** Initializes a counter `c` to store the number of triplets.
3.  **`HashMap<Long, Integer> v1 = new HashMap<>();`** and **`HashMap<Long, Integer> v2 = new HashMap<>();`:**  Creates two hash maps, `v1` and `v2`, to store the squares of the numbers in `nums1` and `nums2`, respectively.  The keys are `Long` to handle potential integer overflow when squaring. The values are integers, representing the frequency of each squared value.
4.  **First `for` loop (for `nums1`):**  Iterates through `nums1`, calculates the square of each number, and stores it in `v1` along with its frequency using `v1.put(v, v1.getOrDefault(v, 0) + 1);`. `getOrDefault` is used to handle cases where the square is seen for the first time.
5.  **Second `for` loop (for `nums2`):** Does the same as the first loop, but for `nums2` and stores the results in `v2`.
6.  **Third `for` loop (nums1 pairs against nums2 squares):**  This is a nested loop. The outer loop iterates through `nums1` from `i = 0` to `nums1.length - 1`. The inner loop iterates from `j = i + 1` to `nums1.length - 1`. This ensures that we are considering distinct pairs of numbers.  Inside the inner loop, the product of `nums1[i]` and `nums1[j]` is calculated and stored in the `product` variable.  It then checks if `v2` (containing the squares of numbers in `nums2`) contains this product as a key using `v2.get(product)`. If the product is a key in `v2` (i.e., some number in `nums2` squared equals this product), the value associated with the key (the frequency of that square) is added to the counter `c`.
7.  **Fourth `for` loop (nums2 pairs against nums1 squares):** This is similar to the third loop, but the roles of `nums1` and `nums2` are swapped.  It iterates through pairs in `nums2` and checks against the squares in `v1`.
8.  **`return c;`:** Returns the final count of triplets.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(M^2 + N^2), where M is the length of `nums1` and N is the length of `nums2`.
    *   Precomputing the squares takes O(M) and O(N) time respectively.
    *   The nested loops iterate through all pairs in `nums1` and `nums2`, which takes O(M^2) and O(N^2) respectively.
    *   Hash map lookups are O(1) on average.
    *   The dominant terms are the nested loops, making the overall time complexity O(M^2 + N^2).

*   **Space Complexity:** O(M + N), where M is the length of `nums1` and N is the length of `nums2`.
    *   The hash maps `v1` and `v2` store at most M and N unique square values, respectively.
