Okay, here's a comprehensive explanation of the provided Java code for the LeetCode problem "Check if Number is a Sum of Powers of Three":

## Check if Number is a Sum of Powers of Three

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to determine whether a given integer `n` can be expressed as the sum of distinct powers of 3.  In other words, we need to check if `n` can be written as  `3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^k` where each power of 3 appears at most once in the sum.

For example:

*   91 can be written as 3^0 + 3^2 + 3^4  (1 + 9 + 81), so `checkPowersOfThree(91)` should return `true`.
*   12 can be written as 3^2 + 3^1 (9+3), so `checkPowersOfThree(12)` should return `true`.
*   21 cannot be written as the sum of distinct powers of 3. You would need 2*3^2+3^0+3^2, so `checkPowersOfThree(21)` should return `false`.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea behind the solution is to repeatedly divide the given number `n` by 3. The key observation is this: If `n` can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 3, then when we express `n` in base 3, each digit can only be 0 or 1. If any digit is 2, it means that we've used a multiple of a power of 3, which violates the distinct powers rule.

Here's why this works:

*   **Base 3 Representation:** Any number can be expressed in base 3. For example, 10 in base 3 is 101 (1\*3^2 + 0\*3^1 + 1\*3^0).
*   **Distinct Powers:**  If `n` is a sum of *distinct* powers of 3, then in its base 3 representation, each place value (representing a power of 3) can either be present (digit 1) or absent (digit 0).
*   **Digit 2:**  If a digit in the base 3 representation is 2, it means that we have 2 \* (some power of 3) in the sum.  This means we need to use that power of 3 *twice*, violating the constraint that powers of 3 must be distinct.

Therefore, the algorithm checks if the remainder of `n` when divided by 3 is ever equal to 2. If it is, it means we cannot represent `n` as the sum of distinct powers of 3.  If we can repeatedly divide `n` by 3 until it becomes 0 without ever encountering a remainder of 2, then `n` can be represented as the sum of distinct powers of 3.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:** No explicit data structures are used (like arrays, lists, or maps).
*   **Algorithms:** The algorithm primarily relies on the modulo operator (`%`) and integer division (`/`) to simulate converting the number to base 3 and checking its digits.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean checkPowersOfThree(int n) {
        while(n>0)
        {
            if(n%3==2) return false;
            n/=3;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

*   **`checkPowersOfThree(int n)` function:**
    *   Takes an integer `n` as input.
    *   **`while(n > 0)` loop:**  This loop continues as long as `n` is greater than 0. In each iteration, we are effectively checking the next digit in the base-3 representation of `n`.
    *   **`if(n % 3 == 2) return false;`:** This is the crucial check. `n % 3` calculates the remainder when `n` is divided by 3. If the remainder is 2, it means the current "digit" in the base-3 representation is 2, and therefore, `n` cannot be written as the sum of distinct powers of 3. In this case, the function immediately returns `false`.
    *   **`n /= 3;`:**  This line performs integer division of `n` by 3.  This effectively moves us to the next "digit" in the base-3 representation (i.e., we are checking the next higher power of 3).
    *   **`return true;`:**  If the `while` loop completes without ever encountering a remainder of 2, it means all the "digits" in the base-3 representation were either 0 or 1. Therefore, `n` can be written as the sum of distinct powers of 3, and the function returns `true`.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(log<sub>3</sub> n).  The `while` loop iterates until `n` becomes 0. In each iteration, `n` is divided by 3.  Therefore, the number of iterations is proportional to the base-3 logarithm of `n`.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1).  The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input value of `n`.  It only uses a few integer variables (`n`).
