## LeetCode: Partition Array Into K-Distinct Groups - Solution Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks whether it's possible to partition a given integer array `nums` into `k` distinct groups such that each group contains the same number of elements.  Crucially, the elements within each group don't need to be unique; it only requires that the array can be divided into `k` equally sized groups.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

This solution cleverly uses a frequency count to determine the feasibility of partitioning without actually performing the partitioning itself.  The core idea is that if the maximum frequency of any number in the array is greater than the size of each group (n/k), it's impossible to partition the array into `k` groups.  If any number appears more times than the allowed number of elements per group, that number alone would exceed the capacity of a single group.

This approach avoids the computationally expensive task of actually creating the groups, significantly improving efficiency. It leverages the fact that a necessary (though not sufficient) condition for successful partitioning is that the frequency of every number must be less than or equal to the group size.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **HashMap (`map`):** Used to store the frequency of each number in the input array.  A HashMap provides O(1) average time complexity for insertion and retrieval, crucial for efficient frequency counting.
* **Integer Variables (`n`, `max`, `k`):**  Used to store the array length, maximum frequency, and the number of groups respectively.
* **Algorithm:** A simple linear scan of the array coupled with frequency counting.  No sophisticated algorithm like dynamic programming or backtracking is required because the problem's constraints allow for this optimization.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **`int n = nums.length;`**: This line gets the length of the input array.
* **`if(n%k != 0) return false;`**: This is a crucial initial check. If the array length isn't divisible by `k`, it's impossible to divide the array into `k` equal-sized groups, so the function immediately returns `false`.
* **`Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();`**: A HashMap is initialized to store the frequency of each number in `nums`.
* **`int max = 0;`**: An integer `max` is initialized to track the maximum frequency encountered so far.
* **`for(int v : nums) { ... }`**: This loop iterates through each element `v` in the `nums` array.
    * **`map.put(v, map.getOrDefault(v, 0)+1);`**: The frequency of `v` is incremented in the `map`. `getOrDefault` handles cases where `v` is encountered for the first time.
    * **`max = Math.max(max, map.get(v));`**: The `max` variable is updated to keep track of the highest frequency encountered.
* **`if(max > n/k) return false;`**: This is the core logic. If the maximum frequency `max` is greater than the size of each group (`n/k`), it's impossible to partition the array, and the function returns `false`.
* **`else return true;`**: Otherwise, it's possible (though not guaranteed) to partition the array, and the function returns `true`.

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the length of the `nums` array.  The loop iterates through the array once to count frequencies. All other operations are constant time.
* **Space Complexity:** O(M), where M is the number of unique elements in the `nums` array. In the worst case, M could be equal to N (all elements are unique),  but typically M will be significantly smaller than N. The space is primarily used by the HashMap to store frequencies.  The other variables use constant space.


**In summary:** This solution provides an efficient and elegant way to determine the feasibility of partitioning an array into `k` distinct groups. By focusing on the maximum frequency of elements, it cleverly avoids the need for explicit partitioning, resulting in significantly improved time complexity compared to a brute-force approach.
