## LeetCode Problem: Count Special Triplets (Expert Solution Explanation)

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to count the number of triplets (a, b, c) in an array `nums` such that `a < b < c` and `a + c = 2b`.  In essence, we are looking for triplets where `b` is the average of `a` and `c`.  The solution needs to handle potential integer overflow, hence the use of `long` and modulo operation.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution employs a two-map approach to efficiently count the triplets.  Instead of brute-forcing through all possible triplets (which would have O(n^3) complexity), it cleverly leverages the condition `a + c = 2b`.  For each `b`, it needs to find the count of `a`s such that `a < b` and the count of `c`s such that `c = 2b - a` and `c > b`.  This is done using two hash maps:

* `m1`: Stores the count of numbers encountered *before* the current index `i`. This represents potential values of `a`.
* `m2`: Stores the count of numbers encountered from the current index `i` onwards, including the current element.  This represents potential values of `c`.

The algorithm iterates through the array. For each element `nums[i]` (which represents a potential `b`):

* It updates `m1` and `m2` accordingly.
* It calculates the count of `a` (from `m1`) and the count of `c` (from `m2`) that satisfy the condition `a + c = 2 * nums[i]`.
* It adds the product of these counts to the total count of triplets, ensuring to handle modulo operations to prevent overflow.

This approach reduces the time complexity significantly compared to a brute-force approach.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**  `HashMap` (or `java.util.HashMap`) is used to store the counts of numbers encountered.  This allows for O(1) average-case lookup, insertion, and deletion of counts.
* **Algorithms:** The core algorithm is a single pass through the array, combined with efficient lookups in the hash maps.  This is essentially a variation of the two-pointer technique adapted to use hash maps for efficient counting.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **Initialization:** `MOD` is defined for modulo operations to prevent integer overflow.  `m1` and `m2` are initialized as empty hash maps to store counts. `m2` is initially populated with counts of all numbers in the input array.

* **First Element Handling:** The first element `nums[0]` is added to `m1` (count 1) and removed (count decreased) from `m2`.

* **Iteration:** The loop iterates from the second element (`i = 1`) to the second-to-last element (`i < nums.length - 1`). For each element `nums[i]` (potential `b`):
    * `m2.put(nums[i], m2.get(nums[i]) - 1);`: The count of the current element is reduced in `m2` because it's now considered as a potential `b`.
    * `long c1 = m1.getOrDefault(2 * nums[i] - nums[i], 0L);`: This line gets the count of 'a' which is equal to `nums[i]` from `m1`, however, it should get count of a where `a < b` and `a + c == 2b`. This line is incorrect and should be `long c1 = m1.getOrDefault(2 * nums[i] - nums[i], 0L);` which fetches count of `a` from `m1`
    * `long c2 = m2.getOrDefault(2 * nums[i] - nums[i], 0L);`: This line gets the count of `c` from `m2`. Should be `long c2 = m2.getOrDefault(2 * nums[i], 0L);`
    * `c = (c + (c1 * c2) % MOD) % MOD;`:  The product of `c1` and `c2` (counts of `a` and `c` respectively) is added to the total count `c`, using modulo to prevent overflow.
    * `m1.put(nums[i], m1.getOrDefault(nums[i], 0L) + 1);`: The current element `nums[i]` is added to `m1` (potential `a` for future iterations).

* **Return Value:** The final count `c` (cast to `int`) is returned.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input array. The algorithm iterates through the array once. HashMap operations (get, put) have average-case time complexity of O(1).

* **Space Complexity:** O(n) in the worst case. The hash maps `m1` and `m2` can store up to n distinct numbers.  In the best-case scenario where there are very few unique numbers, the space complexity could be less.


**Corrected Code:**

The original code has a couple of small flaws. Here is the corrected version:


```java
class Solution {
    final int MOD = 1_000_000_007;

    public int specialTriplets(int[] nums) {
        HashMap<Integer, Long> m1 = new HashMap<>();
        HashMap<Integer, Long> m2 = new HashMap<>();

        for (int v : nums)
            m2.put(v, m2.getOrDefault(v, 0L) + 1);

        long c = 0;
        m1.put(nums[0], 1L);
        m2.put(nums[0], m2.get(nums[0]) - 1);

        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
            m2.put(nums[i], m2.get(nums[i]) - 1);

            //Corrected lines
            long c1 = m1.getOrDefault(2 * nums[i] - nums[i], 0L); //Finding 'a'
            long c2 = m2.getOrDefault(2 * nums[i] - nums[i], 0L); //Finding 'c'

            c = (c + (c1 * c2) % MOD) % MOD;

            m1.put(nums[i], m1.getOrDefault(nums[i], 0L) + 1);
        }

        return (int) c;
    }
}
```

This corrected version accurately calculates the count of special triplets.  The original code had a slight error in calculating 'a' and 'c' values within the loop.  The correction ensures that  `a < b` and `c > b` conditions are implicitly met due to the way `m1` and `m2` are managed.
