## LeetCode: Find the Original Typed String I (Detailed Explanation)

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem, "Find the Original Typed String I,"  asks us to determine the number of possible original strings that could have resulted in a given typed string, assuming that each character in the typed string was typed consecutively with a potential repeat of the preceding character.  For example, if the typed string is "aaabbbcc", there are 6 possible original strings. (abc, aabc, aaabc, abcc, aabbcc, aaabbbcc). This is different from the problem statement given in the code comments!  The code provided actually solves a different problem which counts possible strings only based on consecutive character repetitions.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The provided Java code doesn't directly solve the problem of finding the number of *original* strings that could have produced a given typed string. Instead, it calculates the number of possible strings considering only consecutive repetitions of characters.  For each run of consecutive identical characters, it adds (number of repetitions - 1) to the count of possible strings.  This is because each consecutive repetition represents a choice: either the character was typed once or multiple times consecutively.

Let's clarify with an example:

Input: "aaabbbcc"

The code iterates:

- 'a': counts 3 consecutive 'a's, adding `3 - 1 = 2` to the answer.
- 'b': counts 3 consecutive 'b's, adding `3 - 1 = 2` to the answer.
- 'c': counts 2 consecutive 'c's, adding `2 - 1 = 1` to the answer.

Total possible strings (according to this logic): 1 (initial) + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6

This logic counts the possible strings based solely on the consecutive repetition of characters, not on the combinations of original strings producing the same typed output.

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

- **Data Structure:** The code uses a `char` variable (`cur`) to track the currently processed character and an `int` variable (`cnt`) to count consecutive occurrences of the current character.  It implicitly uses an array (via `word.toCharArray()`) for iteration over the input string.

- **Algorithm:** The algorithm is a simple linear scan of the input string. It employs a greedy approach, incrementally counting consecutive character repetitions and adding to the total count of possible strings.

**4. Code Walkthrough:**

```java
class Solution {
    public int possibleStringCount(String word) { //Calculates possible strings based on consecutive character repetitions.
        int ans = 1; // Initialize the count (at least one string is always possible).
        char cur = '\0'; // Initialize the current character to null.
        int cnt = 1; // Initialize the consecutive character count to 1.

        for(char c : word.toCharArray()) { // Iterate through each character in the string.
            if(cur == c) cnt++; // If the character is the same as the previous one, increment the count.
            else { //If different character encountered
                ans+=cnt-1; // Add (count-1) to the total, accounting for possible repetitions.
                cnt = 1; // Reset the count for the new character.
                cur = c; // Update the current character.
            }
        }
        if(cnt > 0) ans+=cnt-1; //Handle the case of consecutive characters at the end of the string.
        return ans;
    }
}
```

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input string. The code iterates through the string once.

- **Space Complexity:** O(1). The code uses a constant amount of extra space to store variables (`ans`, `cur`, `cnt`).  The space used by `word.toCharArray()` is considered part of the input and not extra space.


**In summary:** The provided code does *not* solve the "Find the Original Typed String I" problem as stated in a typical LeetCode problem description. It solves a simplified problem of counting possible strings based on consecutive character repetitions.  A different approach (likely involving dynamic programming or recursion) would be necessary to correctly address the original problem statement.
