## LeetCode Problem: Taking Maximum Energy From the Mystic Dungeon - Explained

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to find the maximum energy we can collect from a sequence of energy values represented by an array `energy`. We can collect energy from each dungeon (element in the array).  However, there's a constraint: after collecting energy from a dungeon at index `i`, we *must* skip the next `k-1` dungeons.  The goal is to maximize the total energy collected by strategically choosing which dungeons to visit.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is to use dynamic programming to solve this problem. We want to build a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the maximum energy we can collect *up to* dungeon `i`, assuming we *do* take the energy from dungeon `i`.

The intuition behind the DP update rule is as follows:

*   **Base Case (i < k):** If the index `i` is less than `k`, it means we're within the first `k` dungeons.  Since we start at index 0, we can directly take the energy from these dungeons because there's no prior constraint to consider (we haven't visited any dungeons `k` steps before). So, `dp[i] = energy[i]`.
*   **General Case (i >= k):** If `i` is greater than or equal to `k`, we have two choices when deciding whether to take energy from dungeon `i`:
    *   **Take the energy from dungeon `i`:** In this case, we need to consider the maximum energy we could have collected `k` steps before (i.e., `dp[i-k]`). We add the current energy at `i` to `dp[i-k]` to get the potential energy `dp[i-k] + energy[i]`.
    *   **Don't take energy from dungeon `i-k`:** Since dp[i-k] represent the maximum energy collected up to index i-k, we would have already made an optimal choice at index `i-k`. Thus, it is always beneficial to consider `dp[i-k]` when determining if we should take `energy[i]` or not.

After calculating the `dp` array, the last step is to find the maximum energy among the last `k` elements of `dp`. This is because we can end at any of the last `k` dungeons.  We iterate through these last `k` dungeons and find the maximum value.

This approach is chosen because it breaks down the problem into smaller overlapping subproblems (calculating maximum energy up to each dungeon) and stores the solutions to these subproblems to avoid redundant calculations. This allows us to efficiently find the global optimal solution.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:**  An integer array `dp` of size `n+1` is used for dynamic programming.
*   **Algorithms:** Dynamic Programming

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumEnergy(int[] energy, int k) {
        int n = energy.length;
        int[] dp = new int[n+1]; // DP array to store maximum energy up to each index. dp[i] means we *must* take the energy at index i.

        for(int i = 0; i<n; i++) {
            if(i<k) dp[i] = energy[i]; // Base case: If i < k, we can directly take the energy.
            else dp[i] = Math.max(energy[i], dp[i-k]+energy[i]); // General case: Take max of current energy and energy from k steps back.
        }

        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for(int i = n-1; n-i-1 < k && i>=0; i--) max = Math.max(max, dp[i]); // Find max among last k elements.

        return max;
    }
}
```

*   **`maximumEnergy(int[] energy, int k)`:** This is the main function that takes the `energy` array and the skip distance `k` as input.

*   **`int n = energy.length;`:**  Gets the length of the `energy` array and stores it in `n`.

*   **`int[] dp = new int[n+1];`:**  Initializes a DP array `dp` of size `n+1`. `dp[i]` will store the maximum energy obtainable up to index `i` (inclusive). Note that dp[n] is never used.

*   **`for(int i = 0; i<n; i++) { ... }`:**  This loop iterates through the `energy` array from index 0 to `n-1`.

    *   **`if(i<k) dp[i] = energy[i];`:**  If the current index `i` is less than `k`, then `dp[i]` is simply equal to `energy[i]`. This is because we are within the first `k` elements and we can always choose to take the energy.

    *   **`else dp[i] = Math.max(energy[i], dp[i-k]+energy[i]);`:**  If `i` is greater than or equal to `k`, we decide whether to take energy from dungeon `i` or not by considering the decision made `k` steps before i.e., dp[i-k]. The maximum energy up to index `i` is the maximum of either taking only the energy from the current dungeon (`energy[i]`) or taking the current dungeon's energy plus the maximum energy we could have collected up to `k` steps earlier (`dp[i-k] + energy[i]`).

*   **`int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;`:** Initializes a variable `max` to store the maximum energy found so far, using `Integer.MIN_VALUE` to handle potential negative energy values.

*   **`for(int i = n-1; n-i-1 < k && i>=0; i--) max = Math.max(max, dp[i]);`:** This loop iterates through the last `k` elements of the `dp` array to find the maximum energy. We iterate backwards to more easily implement the condition.  `n-i-1 < k` ensures that we only iterate through the last `k` elements, since `n-1-k < i < n`. This is because we can end at any of the last `k` dungeons.

*   **`return max;`:** Returns the maximum energy found.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the `energy` array.  The code iterates through the array once to build the `dp` array, and then iterates at most `k` times to find the maximum energy among the last `k` elements. Since `k` is bounded by `n` in the worst case (and often much smaller), the dominant factor is the first loop which runs in O(n) time.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(n), due to the `dp` array of size `n+1`.
