## Reverse Linked List - Java Solution Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to reverse the order of nodes in a given singly linked list.  We need to modify the `next` pointers of the nodes such that the original head becomes the tail, the original second node becomes the second to last, and so on.  The function should return the head of the newly reversed linked list.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The provided solution uses a recursive approach to reverse the linked list. The core idea is to recursively reverse the sublist starting from the second element (`head.next`).  Once the sublist is reversed, we make the `next` pointer of the second node (which is now at the end of the sublist) point back to the original head. Finally, we need to make the original head's `next` pointer point to `null` since it is now the last element of the reversed list.

Why recursion?  Recursion naturally breaks down the problem into smaller, self-similar subproblems. In this case, reversing a list can be thought of as reversing the sublist starting from the second element and then attaching the first element to the end of the reversed sublist.  This approach is conceptually clean and elegant, though it might be a bit harder to grasp at first compared to an iterative approach.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structure:** Singly Linked List (`ListNode`) is the primary data structure.
*   **Algorithm:** Recursion is used to traverse and modify the linked list's structure.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    private ListNode nxt(ListNode head)
    {
        if(head == null || head.next == null) return head;
        ListNode newhead = nxt(head.next);
        ListNode front = head.next;
        front.next = head;
        head.next = null;
        return newhead;
    }
    public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        return(nxt(head));
    }
}
```

*   **`ListNode` class:** This defines the structure of a node in the linked list.  Each node contains a `val` (the node's data) and a `next` pointer (pointing to the next node in the list).

*   **`reverseList(ListNode head)` method:**
    *   This is the main function that takes the head of the linked list as input.
    *   It calls the recursive helper function `nxt(head)` to perform the actual reversal.
    *   It returns the head of the reversed linked list.

*   **`nxt(ListNode head)` method (Recursive Helper):**
    *   **Base Case:** `if(head == null || head.next == null) return head;`
        *   If the list is empty (`head == null`) or contains only one element (`head.next == null`), it's already reversed (or trivially reversible).  So, the function simply returns the head. This is the base case that stops the recursion.
    *   **Recursive Step:**
        *   `ListNode newhead = nxt(head.next);`
            *   This is the crucial recursive call.  It reverses the sublist starting from the second element (`head.next`).  `newhead` will eventually store the head of the completely reversed sublist.  Because of recursion, `newhead` won't have its final correct value until all the calls on the call stack return.
        *   `ListNode front = head.next;`
            *   Stores a reference to the node *after* `head`.  This is crucial because we will modify `head.next`.
        *   `front.next = head;`
            *   This is where the actual reversal happens. We set the `next` pointer of the node after `head` (originally `head.next`, now at the end of the reversed sublist) to point back to `head`.  This effectively attaches `head` to the end of the already reversed sublist.
        *   `head.next = null;`
            *   This is important to prevent cycles and ensure that the original head becomes the new tail of the reversed list. We set the `next` pointer of `head` (which is now the last element) to `null`.
        *   `return newhead;`
            *   The function returns `newhead`, which is the head of the entire reversed list. Notice that the `newhead` is calculated only once at the deepest level of recursion and then bubbled up through all the calls on the stack, finally becoming the return value of the `reverseList` method.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. The `nxt` function visits each node exactly once during the recursive calls.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(n) due to the recursive call stack. In the worst case (a long linked list), the call stack can grow to a depth of *n*, consuming *n* stack frames. Although no additional data structures of size dependent on *n* are explicitly created, the recursion depth contributes directly to the space complexity. An iterative solution would have O(1) space complexity.
