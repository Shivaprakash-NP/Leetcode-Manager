## Reverse Linked List II Explained

Here's a detailed explanation of the provided Java code for the LeetCode problem "Reverse Linked List II."

### 1. Problem Understanding

The "Reverse Linked List II" problem asks us to reverse a portion of a singly linked list.  Given the head of a linked list and two integers `left` and `right`, we need to reverse the nodes from position `left` to position `right` (inclusive) and return the head of the modified linked list. The indexing starts from 1.

### 2. Approach / Intuition

The core idea is to:

1.  **Locate the Sublist:** Find the nodes just *before* the start of the sublist to be reversed (node at `left - 1`) and the start of the sublist (node at `left`).
2.  **Reverse the Sublist:**  Iteratively reverse the sublist between `left` and `right`. This is done using a standard linked list reversal approach using `prev`, `curr`, and `next` pointers.
3.  **Reconnect the Reversed Sublist:**  After reversing the sublist, we need to reconnect it to the rest of the linked list. We connect the node *before* the sublist (`left-1`) to the *new head* of the reversed sublist and the *new tail* of the reversed sublist to the node *after* the original sublist.

The use of a dummy node (`dum`) simplifies the logic, especially when `left` is 1, as it avoids special-case handling for reversing from the head of the list.
This approach is chosen because it performs the reversal *in-place*, minimizing space usage.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms

*   **Data Structure:**  Singly Linked List
*   **Algorithm:**
    *   Iteration (to traverse the linked list)
    *   Linked List Reversal (using three pointers: `prev`, `cur`, `nxt`)

### 4. Code Walkthrough

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseBetween(ListNode head, int left, int right) {
        if(head == null || head.next == null) return head;
        ListNode dum = new ListNode(0);
        dum.next = head;
        ListNode pre = dum;
        for(int i = 1 ; i<left ; i++) pre = pre.next;
        ListNode cur = pre.next;
        ListNode prev = null;
        ListNode nxt = null;
        for(int i = left ; i<=right ; i++)
        {
            nxt = cur.next;
            cur.next = prev;
            prev = cur;
            cur = nxt;
        }
        pre.next.next = cur;
        pre.next = prev;
        return dum.next;
    }
}
```

*   **`if(head == null || head.next == null) return head;`**:  This is a base case check. If the list is empty or contains only one element, no reversal is needed, so we return the head as is.

*   **`ListNode dum = new ListNode(0); dum.next = head;`**:  A dummy node (`dum`) is created.  Its `next` pointer is set to the original `head`.  This simplifies the logic, especially when `left` is 1, as it provides a consistent starting point for finding the node before the sublist to be reversed.

*   **`ListNode pre = dum; for(int i = 1 ; i<left ; i++) pre = pre.next;`**:  This loop moves the `pre` pointer to the node immediately *before* the sublist that needs to be reversed.  After the loop, `pre` points to the node at position `left - 1`.

*   **`ListNode cur = pre.next;`**: The `cur` pointer is initialized to the node at position `left`, which is the start of the sublist to be reversed.

*   **`ListNode prev = null; ListNode nxt = null;`**:  `prev` and `nxt` pointers are initialized for the standard linked list reversal algorithm. `prev` will initially be `null` because the first node we reverse becomes the *tail* of the reversed sublist, and thus should point to `null`.

*   **`for(int i = left ; i<=right ; i++) { ... }`**: This is the core reversal loop:
    *   **`nxt = cur.next;`**: Stores the next node in the list, so we don't lose it when reversing.
    *   **`cur.next = prev;`**: Reverses the `next` pointer of the current node to point to the previous node.
    *   **`prev = cur;`**: Moves the `prev` pointer to the current node.
    *   **`cur = nxt;`**: Moves the `cur` pointer to the next node.

    After this loop, `prev` points to the *new head* of the reversed sublist, and `cur` points to the node immediately *after* the reversed sublist.

*   **`pre.next.next = cur;`**: This reconnects the *original head* of the reversed sublist to the node *after* the reversed sublist. `pre.next` is the starting point of the reversal (before it was reversed), and now that sublist's last element needs to point at whatever `cur` is pointing at.

*   **`pre.next = prev;`**: This reconnects the node *before* the sublist (pointed to by `pre`) to the *new head* of the reversed sublist (pointed to by `prev`).

*   **`return dum.next;`**:  Returns the `next` pointer of the dummy node, which is the head of the modified linked list.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity

*   **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the length of the linked list. This is because we iterate through the linked list at most twice: once to find the starting point of the sublist to be reversed and once to reverse the sublist itself.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space for the dummy node and the `prev`, `cur`, and `nxt` pointers.  The reversal is done *in-place*.
