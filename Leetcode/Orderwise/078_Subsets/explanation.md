## LeetCode "Subsets" Problem Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The "Subsets" problem asks us to generate all possible subsets (the power set) of a given set of distinct integers.  A subset is a combination of elements from the original set, including the empty set and the set itself. The order of elements within each subset doesn't matter, but the order of subsets in the final output usually doesn't matter either (though LeetCode often expects a specific order).

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The approach taken in the provided code leverages the concept of bit manipulation to efficiently generate all possible subsets.  Here's the intuition:

*   **Representing Subsets with Bits:**  We can represent each subset using a binary number (or bitmask) where each bit corresponds to an element in the input array. If the *j*-th bit is set (1), it means the *j*-th element of the input array `nums` is included in the subset. If the *j*-th bit is not set (0), the *j*-th element is excluded.

*   **Iterating Through All Possible Bitmasks:** If the input array has `n` elements, there are `2^n` possible subsets (the size of the power set). We iterate through all numbers from 0 to `2^n - 1`. Each number represents a unique bitmask and thus a unique subset.

*   **Constructing Subsets based on Bitmasks:** For each bitmask (number), we iterate through the bits from the least significant bit to the most significant bit. If the *j*-th bit of the current bitmask is set, we include `nums[j]` in the subset.

**Why this approach?**

This bit manipulation approach is efficient because it allows us to concisely represent and iterate through all possible combinations of elements in the input array.  It avoids recursion or more complex iterative strategies, leading to a relatively clean and performant solution.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `List<List<Integer>>`: Used to store the resulting list of subsets. Each subset is itself a `List<Integer>`.
    *   `int[] nums`: The input array of integers.

*   **Algorithms:**
    *   **Bit Manipulation:** The core of the solution lies in using bitwise operations (`&` and `<<`) to represent and manipulate subsets.
    *   **Iteration:** Nested loops are used to iterate through all possible bitmasks and the elements of the input array.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> subsets(int[] nums) {
        // Initialize the result list to store all subsets
        List<List<Integer>> val = new ArrayList<List<Integer>>();
        // Get the length of the input array
        int n = nums.length;
        // Calculate the total number of subsets (2^n)
        int totmask = 1 << n;
        // Iterate through all possible bitmasks (from 0 to 2^n - 1)
        for(int i = 0 ; i<totmask ; i++)
        {
            // Initialize a new list to store the current subset
            List<Integer> v1 = new ArrayList<>();
            // Iterate through the elements of the input array
            for(int j = 0 ; j<n ; j++)
                // Check if the j-th bit is set in the current bitmask 'i'
                if((i & (1 << j)) != 0)
                    // If the j-th bit is set, add the j-th element to the current subset
                    v1.add(nums[j]);
            // Add the current subset to the result list
            val.add(v1);
        }
        // Return the list of all subsets
        return val;
    }
}
```

*   **`List<List<Integer>> val = new ArrayList<List<Integer>>();`**:  Initializes an empty list called `val` to store all the generated subsets. This is the main output of the function.

*   **`int n = nums.length;`**:  Gets the number of elements in the input array `nums`. This value is used for calculating the total number of subsets and for iterating through the array.

*   **`int totmask = 1 << n;`**:  Calculates `2^n`, which represents the total number of possible subsets.  The left shift operator `<<` is used for efficient exponentiation by 2.  `1 << n` is equivalent to `Math.pow(2, n)`.

*   **`for(int i = 0 ; i<totmask ; i++)`**:  This is the outer loop that iterates through all possible bitmasks. The loop variable `i` represents the current bitmask.

*   **`List<Integer> v1 = new ArrayList<>();`**:  Inside the outer loop, a new list `v1` is created for each bitmask. This list will hold the elements of the subset corresponding to the current bitmask.

*   **`for(int j = 0 ; j<n ; j++)`**:  This is the inner loop that iterates through each element of the input array `nums`.

*   **`if((i & (1 << j)) != 0)`**:  This is the core of the bit manipulation logic.
    *   `(1 << j)`:  Creates a bitmask with only the *j*-th bit set to 1.  For example, if `j` is 2, then `(1 << j)` results in the binary number `000...0100` (assuming indexing starts from 0 on the right).
    *   `(i & (1 << j))`: Performs a bitwise AND operation between the current bitmask `i` and the bitmask with the *j*-th bit set. If the *j*-th bit is also set in `i`, the result will be non-zero; otherwise, it will be zero.
    *   `!= 0`: Checks if the result of the bitwise AND is non-zero.  If it's non-zero, it means the *j*-th bit is set in the bitmask `i`, indicating that `nums[j]` should be included in the current subset.

*   **`v1.add(nums[j]);`**:  If the *j*-th bit is set in the current bitmask, this line adds the *j*-th element of the input array `nums` to the current subset `v1`.

*   **`val.add(v1);`**:  After processing all elements in the input array for a specific bitmask, the resulting subset `v1` is added to the main result list `val`.

*   **`return val;`**:  Finally, the function returns the `val` list, which contains all the generated subsets.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n * 2<sup>n</sup>)
    *   The outer loop iterates `2^n` times (where `n` is the length of the input array).
    *   The inner loop iterates `n` times.
    *   Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n * 2<sup>n</sup>).

*   **Space Complexity:** O(n * 2<sup>n</sup>)
    *   The output `val` stores `2^n` subsets.
    *   In the worst case, each subset can have up to `n` elements.
    *   Thus, the space required to store the subsets is O(n * 2<sup>n</sup>). In addition, the space occupied by the `v1` temporary list inside the outer loop is O(n). However, the overall space complexity is dominated by the space occupied by `val`.
