## LeetCode: Remove Nth Node From End of List - Solution Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to remove the nth node from the *end* of a singly linked list.  We're given the head of the list and the value `n`.  The solution should modify the list in-place and return the head of the modified list.  Edge cases, such as an empty list or `n` being larger than the list's length, need to be handled gracefully.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The most efficient approach uses a two-pointer technique. We employ two pointers, `s` (slow) and `f` (fast), initialized at the beginning of the list (a dummy node `start` is prepended to simplify handling the removal of the head node).  The fast pointer moves `n` steps ahead of the slow pointer. Then, both pointers move forward simultaneously until the fast pointer reaches the end of the list. At this point, the slow pointer will be positioned exactly `n` nodes before the end, allowing us to remove the nth node from the end by adjusting its `next` pointer.  This two-pointer approach avoids the need for a second pass through the list, making it optimal.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structure:** Singly Linked List
* **Algorithm:** Two-pointer technique

**4. Code Walkthrough:**

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
        ListNode start = new ListNode(); // Dummy node to simplify head removal
        start.next = head;
        ListNode s = start; // Slow pointer
        ListNode f = start; // Fast pointer

        // Move fast pointer n steps ahead
        for(int i = 0 ; i <n ; i++) f = f.next;

        // Move both pointers until fast reaches the end
        while(f.next != null) {
            s = s.next;
            f = f.next;
        }

        // Remove the nth node from the end
        s.next = s.next.next;

        return start.next; // Return the head of the modified list
    }
}
```

* **Lines 1-6:**  Standard ListNode definition.
* **Line 8:**  Creates a `Solution` class containing the method.
* **Line 10:** Creates a dummy node `start`. This cleverly handles the edge case where the nth node is the head.  It simplifies the logic by preventing special handling for removing the head.
* **Lines 11-12:** Initializes slow and fast pointers to the dummy node.
* **Line 14:** Moves the fast pointer `n` steps forward.  If `n` exceeds the list length, `f` will become `null`, and the `while` loop will not execute, correctly leaving the list unchanged.
* **Lines 16-18:** The core two-pointer logic.  Both pointers advance simultaneously until the fast pointer reaches the end of the list.
* **Line 20:**  This is where the removal happens. `s.next` points to the node to be removed, so we skip over it by setting `s.next` to `s.next.next`.
* **Line 22:** Returns the head of the modified list (the node after the dummy node).

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity: O(L)**, where L is the length of the linked list. We traverse the list only once using the two pointers.
* **Space Complexity: O(1)**. The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the list's size.  We only use a few pointers.


This solution is efficient and elegantly handles edge cases due to the use of the dummy node. The two-pointer approach ensures a single pass through the list, leading to optimal time complexity.
