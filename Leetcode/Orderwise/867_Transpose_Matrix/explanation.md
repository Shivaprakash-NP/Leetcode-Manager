## Transpose Matrix Problem and Solution Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The "Transpose Matrix" problem requires us to take a given matrix (a 2D array of integers) and return its transpose. The transpose of a matrix is obtained by swapping its rows and columns.  Specifically, the element at `matrix[i][j]` in the original matrix will be located at `transposed_matrix[j][i]` in the transposed matrix.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The most straightforward approach is to create a new matrix with dimensions swapped (number of columns becomes number of rows and vice-versa). Then, iterate through the original matrix, and for each element `matrix[i][j]`, place it in the new matrix at the position `transposed[j][i]`.  This directly implements the definition of a matrix transpose.  This approach is chosen because it's easy to understand and implement, requiring minimal additional data structures or complex algorithms.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   2D array ( `int[][]` ): Used to represent both the input matrix and the transposed matrix.

*   **Algorithms:**
    *   **Iteration:** Nested loops are used to iterate through each element of the input matrix.
    *   **Direct Assignment:** The core operation is simply assigning the value of `matrix[i][j]` to `transposed[j][i]`.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] transpose(int[][] matrix) {
        int rows = matrix.length;
        int cols = matrix[0].length;
        int[][] transposed = new int[cols][rows];

        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
                transposed[j][i] = matrix[i][j];
            }
        }

        return transposed;
    }
}
```

*   **`class Solution { ... }`**: Defines the class containing the `transpose` method.
*   **`public int[][] transpose(int[][] matrix)`**:  This is the method that takes the input matrix ( `matrix` ) as a 2D integer array and returns the transposed matrix (also as a 2D integer array).
*   **`int rows = matrix.length;`**:  Gets the number of rows in the input matrix. This is equivalent to the length of the outer array.
*   **`int cols = matrix[0].length;`**: Gets the number of columns in the input matrix. This is equivalent to the length of the inner array at the first row (assuming all rows have the same length).  We assume that the input matrix is valid.
*   **`int[][] transposed = new int[cols][rows];`**: Creates a new 2D integer array called `transposed` with dimensions swapped. The number of rows in `transposed` is equal to the number of columns in `matrix`, and the number of columns in `transposed` is equal to the number of rows in `matrix`.  This new array will hold the transposed matrix.
*   **`for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) { ... }`**:  This is the outer loop, which iterates through each row of the input matrix (from row 0 to `rows - 1`).
*   **`for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) { ... }`**: This is the inner loop, which iterates through each column of the input matrix for the current row `i` (from column 0 to `cols - 1`).
*   **`transposed[j][i] = matrix[i][j];`**: This is the core operation. It assigns the value at `matrix[i][j]` to the `transposed` matrix at the index `[j][i]`. This effectively swaps the row and column indices, creating the transpose.
*   **`return transposed;`**:  Returns the newly created `transposed` matrix.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(rows * cols), where 'rows' is the number of rows and 'cols' is the number of columns in the input matrix. This is because the code iterates through each element of the input matrix exactly once.  Therefore, the time complexity is directly proportional to the number of elements in the matrix.

*   **Space Complexity:** O(rows * cols). This is because a new matrix `transposed` is created with dimensions `cols x rows` to store the transpose. The size of this new matrix is proportional to the number of elements in the input matrix. Therefore, the space complexity is O(m*n) where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns.
