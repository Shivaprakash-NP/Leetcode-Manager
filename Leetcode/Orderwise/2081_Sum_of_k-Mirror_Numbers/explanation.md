## LeetCode: Sum of k-Mirror Numbers - Solution Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the sum of the first `n` k-mirror numbers. A k-mirror number is a number that is a palindrome in base `k` and is formed by concatenating a number with its reverse (potentially with a middle digit if the original number has an odd number of digits in base `k`).

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution employs a brute-force approach with optimizations to generate k-mirror numbers and efficiently check if they are palindromes in base `k`.  Instead of checking every number, it iteratively generates potential k-mirror numbers by concatenating numbers with their reverses. The algorithm cleverly exploits the pattern of k-mirror numbers:  it starts with single-digit numbers, then two-digit numbers, and so on, generating candidates efficiently.  The `isKPalindrome` function quickly determines if a number is a palindrome in base `k`. This iterative approach avoids unnecessary computations by focusing only on numbers likely to be k-mirror numbers.

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:** `StringBuilder` is used for efficient string manipulation (reversing strings).  `long` is used to store potentially large numbers.
* **Algorithms:** The core algorithm is an iterative approach combined with a palindrome check. The palindrome check uses two pointers to traverse the string representation of the number in base `k`.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **`isKPalindrome(long num, int k)`:** This function checks if a given number `num` is a palindrome when represented in base `k`. It converts the number to base `k` using modulo operations (`num % k` and `num /= k`), stores it in a `StringBuilder`, and then uses two pointers to compare the digits from the beginning and end to determine if it's a palindrome.

* **`kMirror(int k, int n)`:** This function calculates the sum of the first `n` k-mirror numbers.
    * It initializes `ans` (the sum) to 0 and `len` (the number of digits) to 1.
    * The outer `while (n > 0)` loop iterates through different lengths of numbers (1 digit, 2 digits, 3 digits, and so on).
    * The inner loops generate potential k-mirror numbers:
        * The first inner loop generates numbers where the reversed part is one digit shorter than the original (e.g., 121, 12321, but not 11).
        * The second inner loop generates numbers where the reversed part is the same length as the original (e.g., 11, 1221, 123321).
    * For each potential k-mirror number, it calls `isKPalindrome` to check if it's actually a k-mirror number. If it is, it adds the number to `ans` and decrements `n`.
    * The loop continues until `n` becomes 0 (all `n` k-mirror numbers are found).
    * Finally, it returns the sum `ans`.

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is dominated by the nested loops.  In the worst case, the number of iterations is proportional to the number of k-mirror numbers needed and the number of digits needed to reach the n-th k-mirror number. This makes it difficult to express precisely.  However, it's not strictly polynomial, it can be considered approximately O(n * k<sup>log<sub>10</sub>n</sup>) (because the range of numbers we check increases exponentially with digits). The `isKPalindrome` function has a time complexity of O(log<sub>k</sub>num) where `num` is the size of the number. This is because of the number of steps required to convert to base k which is proportional to the number of digits.

* **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(log<sub>k</sub>num), where num is the largest k-mirror number found. This is due to the space used by `StringBuilder` in the `isKPalindrome` function to store the base-k representation of the number.  The space required to store the number itself is also a factor but typically small compared to the Stringbuilder.  

**In summary:** The solution efficiently generates and checks k-mirror numbers using an iterative approach and a clever base-k palindrome check. Although the time complexity isn't strictly polynomial, the optimizations make it a practical solution for reasonably sized inputs. The space complexity is logarithmic with respect to the magnitude of the largest k-mirror number.
