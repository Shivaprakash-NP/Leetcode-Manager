## Shifting Letters II - Solution Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem "Shifting Letters II" asks us to modify a given string `s` based on a series of shift operations defined in a 2D array `shifts`. Each shift operation in `shifts` is represented as `[start, end, direction]`. This means that for the substring of `s` from index `start` to `end` (inclusive), each character should be shifted either forward (direction 1) or backward (direction 0) by one position in the alphabet. After applying all the shifts, we need to return the modified string.  The shifting is circular, meaning that 'z' shifted forward becomes 'a', and 'a' shifted backward becomes 'z'.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is to efficiently track the *net* shift applied to each character in the string.  A naive approach of directly applying each shift operation to the corresponding substring would lead to a high time complexity (O(n*k) where n is string length and k is number of shifts).  Instead, we use a technique called "difference array" to efficiently calculate the cumulative shift for each position.

Here's the breakdown of the chosen approach:

1.  **Difference Array (netShifts):** Instead of directly modifying the string for each shift operation, we create an auxiliary array `netShifts` to store the *changes* in shift values at specific indices.  When a shift operation `[start, end, direction]` is encountered, we increment `netShifts[start]` by `direction` and decrement `netShifts[end + 1]` by `direction`.  This encodes the fact that the characters from index `start` to `end` are affected by the shift specified by `direction`.

2.  **Cumulative Sum (cumulativeShift):** After processing all the shift operations, we compute a cumulative sum of the `netShifts` array. This gives us the total shift that needs to be applied to each character in the string.  For example, `cumulativeShift[i]` will contain the cumulative shift amount that needs to be applied to character at index `i`.

3.  **Applying the Shift:**  Finally, we iterate through the original string `s`, and for each character, we apply the corresponding cumulative shift.  We perform a modulo operation (`% 26`) to handle the circular wrapping of the alphabet (e.g., 'z' shifted by 1 becomes 'a').  A double modulo operation `((cumulativeShift % 26) + 26) % 26` is used to handle negative cumulative shifts correctly in java.

This approach significantly improves the efficiency, reducing the number of operations from O(n*k) to O(n+k) by applying the shift operations in O(k) time and calculating cumulative shifts and constructing the modified string in O(n) time.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `String`: The input string `s` and the output string are stored as strings.
    *   `int[]`: The `netShifts` array acts as a difference array to store shift changes.
    *   `int[][]`: The `shifts` array stores the shift operations.
    *   `StringBuilder`: Used for efficient modification of the string.

*   **Algorithms:**
    *   **Difference Array Technique:** Used to efficiently update the shift values for a range of indices.
    *   **Cumulative Sum:** Used to calculate the total shift applied to each character.
    *   **Modulo Operator:** Used to handle the circular wrapping of characters in the alphabet.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public String shiftingLetters(String s, int[][] shifts) {
        int n = s.length();
        int[] netShifts = new int[n + 1]; // Initialize the difference array. Size is n+1 to handle shifts ending at the last index.
        
        
        for (int[] v : shifts) // Iterate through the shift operations.
        {
            int start = v[0], end = v[1] + 1; // Extract start and end indices (end is exclusive in the difference array).
            int direction = (v[2] == 0) ? -1 : 1; // Determine the direction of the shift (-1 for backward, 1 for forward).
            netShifts[start] += direction; // Increment the shift at the start index.
            netShifts[end] -= direction; // Decrement the shift after the end index.
        }
        
        int cumulativeShift = 0; // Keep track of the cumulative shift as we iterate through the string.
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(s); // Use StringBuilder for efficient string modification.
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) // Iterate through the string.
        {
            cumulativeShift += netShifts[i]; // Update the cumulative shift.
            int shift = ((cumulativeShift % 26) + 26) % 26; // Calculate the effective shift value (handles negative values correctly).
            char newChar = (char) ('a' + (sb.charAt(i) - 'a' + shift + 26) % 26); // Calculate the new character after applying the shift.
            sb.setCharAt(i, newChar); // Update the character in the StringBuilder.
        }
        
        return sb.toString(); // Return the modified string.
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`int n = s.length();`**: Gets the length of the input string `s`.
2.  **`int[] netShifts = new int[n + 1];`**: Creates an integer array `netShifts` of size `n + 1`. This array will store the difference in shifts.  The extra element is needed to properly handle the end of shift intervals.
3.  **`for (int[] v : shifts)`**:  Iterates through each shift operation `v` in the `shifts` array.
4.  **`int start = v[0], end = v[1] + 1;`**: Extracts the start and end indices from the current shift operation. Note that `end` is incremented by 1 because we are using the `netShifts` array to mark where the shift *ends*.
5.  **`int direction = (v[2] == 0) ? -1 : 1;`**: Determines the direction of the shift. If `v[2]` is 0, the direction is -1 (backward); otherwise, it's 1 (forward).
6.  **`netShifts[start] += direction;`**:  Adds the `direction` to the `netShifts` array at the `start` index.  This marks the beginning of the shift.
7.  **`netShifts[end] -= direction;`**:  Subtracts the `direction` from the `netShifts` array at the `end` index. This marks the end of the shift.
8.  **`int cumulativeShift = 0;`**: Initializes a variable `cumulativeShift` to 0. This variable will store the cumulative shift for each character.
9.  **`StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(s);`**: Creates a `StringBuilder` object `sb` with the initial value of the input string `s`.  `StringBuilder` is used for efficient string modification.
10. **`for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)`**:  Iterates through each character in the string.
11. **`cumulativeShift += netShifts[i];`**:  Updates the `cumulativeShift` by adding the value from the `netShifts` array at the current index `i`.
12. **`int shift = ((cumulativeShift % 26) + 26) % 26;`**: Calculates the effective shift value. The modulo operation `% 26` ensures that the shift value stays within the range of the alphabet (0-25).  The `+ 26` and subsequent modulo operation handle negative `cumulativeShift` values correctly, ensuring that the result is always non-negative.
13. **`char newChar = (char) ('a' + (sb.charAt(i) - 'a' + shift + 26) % 26);`**: Calculates the new character after applying the shift.
    *   `sb.charAt(i) - 'a'`: Gets the index of the current character in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.).
    *   `+ shift`: Adds the calculated shift value to the index.
    *   `+ 26`: Adds 26 to handle potential negative values after the shift. This is crucial to ensure that the modulo operation works correctly for negative shifts.
    *   `% 26`: Takes the modulo of 26 to wrap around the alphabet.
    *   `'a' + ...`: Adds the result to 'a' to get the ASCII value of the new character.
    *   `(char) ...`: Casts the ASCII value to a character.
14. **`sb.setCharAt(i, newChar);`**:  Sets the character at index `i` in the `StringBuilder` to the new character.
15. **`return sb.toString();`**:  Returns the modified string.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n + k), where `n` is the length of the string `s` and `k` is the number of shift operations in the `shifts` array.
    *   Iterating through the `shifts` array takes O(k) time.
    *   Calculating the cumulative sum and constructing the modified string takes O(n) time.

*   **Space Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
    *   The `netShifts` array requires O(n) space.
    *   The `StringBuilder` `sb` also requires O(n) space.
