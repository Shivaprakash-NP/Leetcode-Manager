## LeetCode Problem: Coupon Code Validator - Detailed Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem requires validating a set of coupon codes based on several criteria:  The code must be active, belong to a valid business line (electronics, grocery, pharmacy, or restaurant), and consist only of alphanumeric characters and underscores.  The solution should return a list of valid coupon codes, sorted alphabetically within each business line, and then concatenated in the order: electronics, grocery, pharmacy, restaurant.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution uses a filtering and grouping approach. It iterates through the input arrays (coupon codes, business lines, and active status), filtering out invalid entries based on the specified criteria. Valid coupons are then grouped by their business line using a `Map`. Finally, the coupons within each business line are sorted alphabetically, and the result is concatenated into a single list in the specified order. This approach is efficient because it avoids unnecessary processing of invalid coupons and performs sorting only on the valid subset of coupons within each category. A `TreeMap` is used to ensure the business lines are processed in the correct order (electronics, grocery, pharmacy, restaurant).


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * `String[]`:  Used to store arrays of coupon codes and business lines.
    * `boolean[]`: Used to store the active status of each coupon.
    * `List<String>`: Used to store the list of valid coupon codes as the final output.
    * `Map<String, List<String>>`: A `TreeMap` is used to store valid coupon codes grouped by business line. The `TreeMap` ensures the order of business lines is maintained.
    * `ArrayList<String>`: Used to create the lists of coupons for each business line within the map.

* **Algorithms:**
    * **Filtering:** The code iterates through the input arrays and applies conditional statements to filter out invalid coupons.
    * **Grouping:** The `Map` data structure is used to group coupons by their business line.
    * **Sorting:** `Collections.sort()` is used to sort the coupons within each business line alphabetically.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **`is(String s)` function:** This helper function checks if a given coupon code `s` contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores. It iterates through each character of the string and returns `false` if an invalid character is found. Otherwise, it returns `true`.

* **`validateCoupons(String[] code, String[] businessLine, boolean[] isActive)` function:**
    * It initializes an empty list `ans` to store the result.
    * It initializes a `TreeMap` `map` to store valid coupon codes grouped by business line.  `TreeMap` maintains the order of keys (business lines).
    * It iterates through the input arrays using a `for` loop.
    * Inside the loop:
        * It checks if the coupon is active (`isActive[i] == false`). If not, it continues to the next iteration.
        * It checks if the business line is valid (electronics, grocery, pharmacy, or restaurant). If not, it continues.
        * It calls the `is()` function to check if the coupon code is valid. If not, it continues.
        * If the coupon is valid, it adds it to the `map` under its corresponding business line. If the business line doesn't exist in the map, a new list is created.
    * After processing all coupons, it iterates through the four business lines ("electronics", "grocery", "pharmacy", "restaurant").
    * For each business line:
        * If the business line exists in the `map`, it sorts the list of coupons using `Collections.sort()`.
        * It adds the sorted list of coupons to the `ans` list.
    * Finally, it returns the `ans` list.

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(N log N), where N is the number of coupon codes. The dominant operations are the iterations through the input arrays (O(N)) and sorting the coupons within each business line (O(M log M) for each business line, where M is the number of coupons in that line).  In the worst case, all coupons could be valid, leading to a total time complexity of O(N log N).

* **Space Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of coupon codes. The space used is primarily for the `map` which, in the worst-case scenario (all coupons are valid), will store all the coupons.  The `ans` list also takes space proportional to the number of valid coupons.  Therefore, the space complexity is linear with the number of input coupons.
