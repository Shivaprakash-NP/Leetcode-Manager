## LeetCode Problem: Check If Digits Are Equal in String After Operations I - Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to repeatedly perform an operation on a string of digits. In each operation, we replace consecutive pairs of digits with the last digit of their sum. We repeat this operation until the string has length 2. The goal is to determine whether the two digits that remain are equal.

For example, if the initial string is "12345", the first operation results in "3579". The next results in "826", then "08" and finally we return true because '0' == '8'.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The most straightforward approach is to directly simulate the operations as described in the problem statement.  We iterate the process: take two consecutive digits, compute the last digit of their sum, and form a new string.  We continue this until we are left with a string of length 2.  Then we compare the two digits.

This approach is chosen because it is a direct translation of the problem description into code.  Since the operations are performed until the string is very short (length 2), the time complexity remains acceptable, making it an efficient solution.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structure:** `StringBuilder` is used to efficiently manipulate the string of digits.  Strings in Java are immutable, so repeated concatenation would be inefficient. `StringBuilder` allows in-place modification.
*   **Algorithm:** Iteration/Simulation. We use a `while` loop to repeat the reduction process until the string length is 2. Inside the loop, we iterate through the string (using a `for` loop) to perform the digit addition and form a new string.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean hasSameDigits(String s) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(s); // Initialize StringBuilder with the input string
        while (sb.length() > 2) { // Continue as long as the string length is greater than 2
            StringBuilder temp = new StringBuilder(); // Create a new StringBuilder to store the result of the current operation
            for (int i = 0; i < sb.length() - 1; i++) { // Iterate through the string, taking pairs of digits
                int v1 = sb.charAt(i) - '0'; // Convert the first digit to an integer
                int v2 = sb.charAt(i + 1) - '0'; // Convert the second digit to an integer
                temp.append((char) ((v1 + v2) % 10 + '0')); // Calculate the last digit of the sum and append it to the new string
            }
            sb = temp; // Update the original StringBuilder with the new string
        }
        return sb.charAt(0) == sb.charAt(1); // Compare the two remaining digits and return true if they are equal, false otherwise
    }
}
```

**Line-by-line Explanation:**

1.  `StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(s);`: Creates a `StringBuilder` object `sb` initialized with the input string `s`.  This allows for efficient string manipulation.

2.  `while (sb.length() > 2)`: This `while` loop continues as long as the length of the string is greater than 2.  This is the main loop that performs the operations repeatedly.

3.  `StringBuilder temp = new StringBuilder();`: Inside the `while` loop, a new `StringBuilder` object `temp` is created to store the intermediate result of each operation.

4.  `for (int i = 0; i < sb.length() - 1; i++)`: This `for` loop iterates through the string `sb`, taking pairs of consecutive digits.  It stops one element short of the end to avoid an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.

5.  `int v1 = sb.charAt(i) - '0';`: Converts the character at index `i` to an integer. Subtracting `'0'` (ASCII value 48) from a digit character converts it to its corresponding integer value.

6.  `int v2 = sb.charAt(i + 1) - '0';`: Converts the character at index `i + 1` to an integer.

7.  `temp.append((char) ((v1 + v2) % 10 + '0'));`: Calculates the sum of the two digits (`v1 + v2`), takes the last digit by using the modulo operator (`% 10`), and then converts the result back to a character by adding `'0'`.  This character is appended to the `temp` `StringBuilder`.

8.  `sb = temp;`:  After the `for` loop completes, the `sb` is updated with the string stored in `temp`. This represents performing one operation.

9.  `return sb.charAt(0) == sb.charAt(1);`: After the `while` loop terminates (when the string length is 2), this line compares the two remaining characters in the `StringBuilder`. It returns `true` if they are equal and `false` otherwise.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n^2) where n is the length of the input string. In each iteration of the while loop, the length of the string is reduced by one. The loop runs at most n-2 times.  Inside the while loop, there is a for loop which runs in O(n) where n is the length of the string in that iteration. In the worst case (where the string reduces slowly), we will have roughly O(n) + O(n-1) + O(n-2) + ... + O(3) operations, which sums to O(n^2).

*   **Space Complexity:** O(n) where n is the length of the input string.  The `StringBuilder` `sb` initially stores the input string.  In each iteration, `temp` also holds a string that is roughly the same length as the current length of `sb`. Thus, the space complexity is dominated by the `StringBuilder`s which require O(n) space.
