## LeetCode: House Robber II - Detailed Solution Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The "House Robber II" problem extends the classic "House Robber" problem.  We're given a circular array of houses, where each house contains a certain amount of money.  The goal is to maximize the amount of money we can rob without robbing two adjacent houses.  Crucially, the last house and the first house are considered adjacent in this circular arrangement.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The key insight is that we can't directly apply the standard dynamic programming approach used in the original "House Robber" problem because of the circularity.  Robbing the first house automatically prevents robbing the last house, and vice versa.

Therefore, we split the problem into two subproblems:

1. **Rob houses from index 0 to n-2 (excluding the last house):**  This subproblem is a standard "House Robber" problem.
2. **Rob houses from index 1 to n-1 (excluding the first house):** This is also a standard "House Robber" problem.


We solve each subproblem using dynamic programming, specifically a bottom-up approach (iterative), which is efficient and avoids recursion overhead.  Finally, we take the maximum of the results from both subproblems to obtain the optimal solution for the circular arrangement.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:** We primarily use an array (`nums`) to store the amounts of money in each house.  We also create sub-arrays using `Arrays.copyOfRange`.
* **Algorithms:** The core algorithm is dynamic programming, specifically a bottom-up iterative approach.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **`find(int[] nums)` method:** This is a helper function that solves the standard "House Robber" problem for a given array.

    * `int n = nums.length;`: Gets the length of the input array.
    * `int pre1 = nums[0];`: Initializes `pre1` to the amount in the first house.  This represents the maximum amount that can be robbed considering the first house.
    * `int pre2 = 0;`: Initializes `pre2` to 0. This represents the maximum amount that can be robbed considering only the houses before the current one.
    * `for(int i = 1; i < n; i++)`: Iterates through the houses, starting from the second one.
    * `int take = pre2 + nums[i];`: Calculates the maximum amount if we rob the current house (`nums[i]`). It adds the current house value to the maximum amount achievable from houses before the previous one (`pre2`).
    * `int notake = pre1;`: Calculates the maximum amount if we don't rob the current house.  This is simply the maximum amount achievable from previous houses (`pre1`).
    * `int cur = Math.max(take, notake);`: Takes the maximum of robbing or not robbing the current house.
    * `pre2 = pre1; pre1 = cur;`: Updates `pre2` and `pre1` for the next iteration.
    * `return pre1;`: Returns the maximum amount that can be robbed.


* **`rob(int[] nums)` method:** This is the main method that handles the circular case.

    * `int n = nums.length;`: Gets the length of the input array.
    * `if(n == 1) return nums[0];`: Handles the base case of only one house.
    * `return Math.max(find(Arrays.copyOfRange(nums, 0, n-1)), find(Arrays.copyOfRange(nums, 1, n)));`: Creates two subarrays (excluding the last and the first house respectively), calls the `find` method on each, and returns the maximum of the two results.

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(n). The `find` function iterates through the array once, and it's called twice in the `rob` function.  `Arrays.copyOfRange` has a time complexity of O(n) as well, but this is dominated by the iteration in `find`.

* **Space Complexity:** O(n) in the worst case. This is because of the creation of subarrays using `Arrays.copyOfRange`.  However, if we optimize the code to avoid explicit subarray creation and instead use only indices, we could reduce this to O(1).  The space used by variables `pre1`, `pre2`, etc., is constant.

In summary, the solution efficiently solves the "House Robber II" problem by cleverly breaking down the circular arrangement into two linear subproblems and applying dynamic programming to each. The time complexity is linear, and the space complexity is linearly dependent on array creation but can be optimized to constant space.
