## Minimum Number of Operations to Move All Balls to Each Box - Detailed Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem states that we are given a string `boxes` where each character represents a box. '1' indicates a box has a ball, and '0' indicates an empty box.  The goal is to calculate, for each box, the minimum number of operations required to move all the balls to that box. An operation consists of moving a ball one position to the left or right. The final result should be an array where the i-th element is the minimum number of operations to move all balls to the i-th box.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is straightforward:  For each box, we iterate through all the other boxes that contain balls ('1'). For each ball-containing box, we calculate the distance between that box and the current box we're targeting. The sum of all these distances for a given target box will be the minimum number of operations needed to move all balls to that box.

This approach is chosen for its simplicity and direct translation from the problem statement.  We don't need any complex data structures or algorithms because the constraints (string length `n <= 2000`) are relatively small, making a brute-force approach acceptable.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **`ArrayList<Integer>`:** Used to store the indices of the boxes that contain balls ('1'). This allows us to efficiently iterate only through boxes that have balls.
*   **`int[]`:**  The `answer` array stores the results, i.e., the minimum number of operations for each box.
*   **`Math.abs()`:** This function is used to calculate the absolute difference between the index of a ball-containing box and the current target box index, which represents the number of operations to move that particular ball to the target box.
*   **Algorithm:** Brute-force iteration. We iterate through each box and then iterate through the list of boxes containing balls.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] minOperations(String boxes) {
        ArrayList<Integer> val = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int i = 0 ; i<boxes.length() ; i++)
            if(boxes.charAt(i)=='1')
                val.add(i);
        int[] answer = new int[boxes.length()];
        for(int i = 0  ; i<boxes.length() ; i++)
        {
            for(int v : val)
            {
                answer[i]+=Math.abs(v-i);
            }
        }
        return answer;
    }
}
```

1.  **`ArrayList<Integer> val = new ArrayList<>();`**: Initializes an `ArrayList` called `val`. This list will store the indices of all the boxes that contain balls ('1').

2.  **`for(int i = 0 ; i<boxes.length() ; i++)`**: This loop iterates through the input string `boxes`.

3.  **`if(boxes.charAt(i)=='1')`**: Inside the loop, this `if` statement checks if the character at the current index `i` is equal to '1'.

4.  **`val.add(i);`**: If the character is '1', the index `i` is added to the `val` list.  So, after this loop, `val` will contain the indices of all the boxes containing balls.

5.  **`int[] answer = new int[boxes.length()];`**: Initializes an integer array `answer` of the same length as the input string `boxes`. This array will store the minimum number of operations required for each box.

6.  **`for(int i = 0  ; i<boxes.length() ; i++)`**: This outer loop iterates through each box in the input string `boxes`. The index `i` represents the box to which we are moving all the balls.

7.  **`for(int v : val)`**: This inner loop iterates through the `val` list, which contains the indices of all the boxes with balls. `v` represents the index of a box containing a ball.

8.  **`answer[i]+=Math.abs(v-i);`**:  This is the crucial calculation step.  `Math.abs(v-i)` calculates the absolute difference between the index of a ball-containing box (`v`) and the index of the target box (`i`). This difference represents the number of operations needed to move the ball from box `v` to box `i`.  This value is then added to `answer[i]`, accumulating the total number of operations needed to move all balls to box `i`.

9.  **`return answer;`**: After the loops complete, the `answer` array, containing the minimum number of operations for each box, is returned.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n\*m), where `n` is the length of the `boxes` string and `m` is the number of boxes that contain balls. In the worst-case scenario where all boxes contain balls, m will be approximately equal to n, leading to O(n^2) complexity. The nested loops are the dominating factor here.  Specifically:
    *   The first loop to create the `val` list is O(n).
    *   The outer loop iterates `n` times.
    *   The inner loop iterates `m` times (number of balls).
    *   Therefore, the dominant part is O(n * m) which can be approximated to O(n^2) in the worst case.

*   **Space Complexity:** O(m), where `m` is the number of boxes that contain balls ('1'). This is because the `val` ArrayList stores the indices of these boxes. The `answer` array has a size of `n`, but since `m` can also be close to `n` in the worst case, it can also be said that the space complexity is O(n).  We use additional space for `val` and `answer`.
