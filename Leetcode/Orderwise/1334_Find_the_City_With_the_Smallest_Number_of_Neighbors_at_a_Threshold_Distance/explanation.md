## LeetCode: Find the City With the Smallest Number of Neighbors at a Threshold Distance

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the city (represented by an index) with the fewest number of cities within a given `distanceThreshold`.  The distances between cities are provided as weighted edges in a graph. We need to find the shortest paths between all pairs of cities and then count the number of cities reachable within the threshold distance from each city. The city with the minimum count is the answer.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution employs Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find the shortest paths between all pairs of cities.  Floyd-Warshall is chosen because it efficiently computes the shortest paths for all pairs of nodes in a weighted graph, even with cycles. After computing the shortest paths, the algorithm iterates through each city, counts the number of cities reachable within the `distanceThreshold`, and selects the city with the minimum count.

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * `int[][] map`: A 2D array representing the adjacency matrix of the graph. `map[i][j]` stores the shortest distance between city `i` and city `j`.  `INF` (a large value) represents infinity, indicating no direct path.
* **Algorithms:**
    * **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:**  Used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph.
    * **Iteration and Counting:**  Iterating through cities to count reachable cities within the threshold.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **Initialization:**
    ```java
    int[][] map = new int[n][n];
    int INF = 100000000; 

    for(int i = 0; i<n; i++) {
        Arrays.fill(map[i], INF);
        map[i][i] = 0;
    }
    ```
    This section initializes the adjacency matrix `map`.  `INF` is set to a large number representing infinity.  The matrix is filled with `INF` initially, except for the diagonal, which represents the distance from a city to itself (0).

* **Edge Processing:**
    ```java
    for(int[] e : edges) {
        int u = e[0];
        int v = e[1];
        int w = e[2];
        map[u][v] = w;
        map[v][u] = w;
    }
    ```
    This section populates the adjacency matrix with the given edges.  `u` and `v` represent the cities connected by an edge, and `w` represents the weight (distance) of the edge.  The matrix is made symmetric since the distance between two cities is the same regardless of direction.

* **Floyd-Warshall Implementation:**
    ```java
    for(int v = 0; v<n; v++) {
        for(int i = 0; i<n; i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j<n; j++) {
                map[i][j] = Math.min(map[i][v]+map[v][j], map[i][j]);
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    This is the core of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. It iterates through all possible intermediate vertices (`v`) to find the shortest path between all pairs of cities (`i` and `j`). It updates `map[i][j]` with the minimum distance found so far.

* **City Counting and Result Selection:**
    ```java
    int ans = 0;
    int rec = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    for(int i = 0; i<n; i++) {
        int c = 0;
        for(int j = 0; j<n; j++) {
            if(i!=j && map[i][j] <= distanceThreshold) c++;
        }
        if(c <= rec) {
            rec = c;
            ans = i;
        }
    }
    return ans;
    ```
    This section iterates through each city (`i`) and counts the number of cities (`c`) reachable within the `distanceThreshold`. It keeps track of the city with the minimum count (`rec`) and its index (`ans`).  The final `ans` is returned.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(n³), dominated by the Floyd-Warshall algorithm which has a cubic time complexity. The final iteration to count reachable cities is O(n²).
* **Space Complexity:** O(n²), due to the adjacency matrix `map`.


In summary, this Java code efficiently solves the problem using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for all-pairs shortest paths and then performs a linear scan to find the city satisfying the given condition. The cubic time complexity is inherent to the all-pairs shortest path problem, and the quadratic space complexity is necessary to represent the graph's adjacency matrix.
