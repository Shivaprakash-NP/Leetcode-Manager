## Longest Fibonacci Subarray Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to find the length of the longest *contiguous* subarray within a given array `nums` that forms a Fibonacci-like sequence. A Fibonacci-like sequence is defined as a sequence where each element is the sum of the two preceding elements (similar to the Fibonacci sequence). We need to return the maximum length of such a subarray. The length of the Fibonacci-like sequence has to be at least 3.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The approach is based on a simple iterative scan through the input array `nums`. The key idea is to keep track of the current length of a potential Fibonacci-like subarray as we iterate.

*   We initialize a counter `c` to 2 because a Fibonacci-like sequence needs at least three elements.  We'll start checking from the third element (`i = 2`) to see if it matches the sum of the previous two.
*   For each element, we check if `nums[i]` is equal to `nums[i-2] + nums[i-1]`. If it is, we increment the counter `c`.
*   If the current element doesn't satisfy the Fibonacci-like condition, it means the current sequence has ended. We then update the maximum length encountered so far (`max`) with the current length `c` (if `c` is greater than `max`). We also reset `c` back to 2 to start counting a new potential Fibonacci-like subarray.
*   Finally, after the loop finishes, there might be a Fibonacci-like sequence that extends to the very end of the array.  So, we need to update `max` one last time outside the loop.

This approach is chosen because it's a straightforward way to identify and track the length of contiguous Fibonacci-like subarrays.  It avoids unnecessary complexity, using a simple iteration and comparison.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:** The primary data structure used is an integer array `nums`.  No other complex data structures are involved.
*   **Algorithms:** The algorithm uses a basic iterative scan (a `for` loop) to traverse the array and conditional statements (`if/else`) for checking the Fibonacci-like condition.  It also utilizes `Math.max()` to keep track of the maximum length seen so far.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestSubarray(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE; // Initialize max to the smallest possible integer. This will be updated with valid values.

        int c = 2; // Initialize the counter to 2, as a Fibonacci-like sequence requires at least 3 elements. We begin considering our sequence from the third element.
        for(int i = 2; i<n; i++) { // Iterate through the array starting from the third element (index 2).
            if(nums[i-2] + nums[i-1] == nums[i]) c++; // Check if the current element is the sum of the previous two. If so, increment the counter.
            else {
                max = Math.max(max, c); // If the condition is not met, update the maximum length if the current length is greater.
                c = 2; // Reset the counter to 2 to start counting a new potential Fibonacci-like subarray.
            }
        }

        max = Math.max(max, c); // Update max one last time after the loop, in case the longest sequence extends to the end of the array.
        return max > 2 ? max : 0; // return max length, if it is more than 2 else return 0.
    }
}
```

**Line-by-line explanation:**

1.  `class Solution {`: Defines the `Solution` class.
2.  `public int longestSubarray(int[] nums) {`: Defines the `longestSubarray` method, which takes an integer array `nums` as input and returns an integer representing the length of the longest Fibonacci-like subarray.
3.  `int n = nums.length;`: Gets the length of the input array and stores it in `n`.
4.  `int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;`: Initializes `max` to the smallest possible integer value. This variable will store the length of the longest Fibonacci-like subarray found so far.  Initializing to the minimum possible integer ensures that any valid subarray length will be greater.
5.  `int c = 2;`: Initializes `c` to 2.  This variable represents the length of the *current* Fibonacci-like subarray being examined. We start at 2, as we need a sequence of at least 3 elements.
6.  `for(int i = 2; i<n; i++) {`: Starts a `for` loop that iterates from the third element (index 2) to the end of the array.
7.  `if(nums[i-2] + nums[i-1] == nums[i]) c++;`: Checks if the current element `nums[i]` is equal to the sum of the two preceding elements `nums[i-2]` and `nums[i-1]`. If it is, it means the current element extends the current Fibonacci-like sequence, so we increment the counter `c`.
8.  `else {`: If the current element doesn't satisfy the Fibonacci-like condition:
9.  `max = Math.max(max, c);`: Update `max` to be the larger of its current value and the current length `c`. This ensures that `max` always stores the maximum length encountered so far.
10. `c = 2;`: Reset `c` to 2, starting a new count of the potential Fibonacci-like subarray beginning from the next element.
11. `}`: Closes the `else` block.
12. `}`: Closes the `for` loop.
13. `max = Math.max(max, c);`: After the loop completes, there might be a Fibonacci-like subarray extending to the end of the array. This line updates `max` one last time to account for this possibility.
14. `return max > 2 ? max : 0;`: Returns the `max` length if `max` is greater than 2 (because the Fibonacci sequence has to have at least 3 elements), otherwise it return 0.
15. `}`: Closes the `longestSubarray` method.
16. `}`: Closes the `Solution` class.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** The algorithm iterates through the array once using a `for` loop.  Inside the loop, there are constant-time operations (addition, comparison, `Math.max()`). Therefore, the time complexity is **O(n)**, where n is the length of the input array.

*   **Space Complexity:** The algorithm uses a few integer variables (`n`, `max`, `c`, `i`). These variables require constant space, regardless of the input array size. Therefore, the space complexity is **O(1)** (constant).
