## LeetCode Problem: Next Greater Element I - Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem "Next Greater Element I" asks us to find the next greater element for each number in `nums1` within `nums2`.  `nums1` is a subset of `nums2`.  For each element `x` in `nums1`, we need to find the first element in `nums2` that is greater than `x`, searching from the position of `x` in `nums2` towards the right. If there is no such greater element, we should return -1 for that number.

For example, if `nums1 = [4,1,2]` and `nums2 = [1,3,4,2]`, the answer would be `[-1, 3, -1]`.

*   For 4 in `nums1`, it's found at index 2 in `nums2`.  There's no greater number to its right in `nums2`, so the answer is -1.
*   For 1 in `nums1`, it's found at index 0 in `nums2`. The next greater number is 3.
*   For 2 in `nums1`, it's found at index 3 in `nums2`. There's no greater number to its right in `nums2`, so the answer is -1.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The key idea is to precompute the next greater element for *every* element in `nums2` and store it in a hash map.  This avoids redundant searches for each element of `nums1`. Then, we can easily lookup the next greater element of any number from `nums1`.

The most efficient way to find the next greater element for all numbers in `nums2` is to use a stack. We iterate through `nums2` from right to left.  The stack helps us maintain a decreasing sequence of elements seen so far.

Why this approach?

*   **Efficiency:** Precomputing next greater elements for `nums2` avoids repeatedly searching `nums2` for each element in `nums1`.
*   **Stack for Decreasing Sequence:** The stack efficiently keeps track of potential next greater elements as we traverse `nums2` backward.  If the current element is greater than the top of the stack, it means the elements on the stack are not the next greater element for any element seen previously, so we pop them until we find a greater element or the stack is empty.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Stack:** Used to maintain a decreasing sequence of numbers encountered while iterating through `nums2` from right to left.
*   **HashMap:** Used to store the next greater element for each number in `nums2`. The key is the number from `nums2`, and the value is its next greater element.
*   **Array:** Used to store and return the result (`ans`).
*   **Iteration:** We iterate through `nums2` and `nums1`.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] nextGreaterElement(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        Stack<Integer> st = new Stack<>();
        HashMap<Integer , Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

        // Iterate through nums2 from right to left
        for(int i = nums2.length-1 ; i>=0 ; i--) {
            // While the stack is not empty and the current element in nums2 is greater than or equal to the top of the stack
            while(!st.isEmpty() && nums2[i]>=st.peek()) {
                st.pop(); // Pop elements from the stack because they can't be the next greater element for nums2[i] or any elements seen previously.
            }

            // If the stack is empty, there's no next greater element for nums2[i]
            if(st.isEmpty()) {
                map.put(nums2[i] , -1);
            } else {
                // The top of the stack is the next greater element for nums2[i]
                map.put(nums2[i] , st.peek());
            }

            // Push the current element onto the stack
            st.push(nums2[i]);
        }

        // Create the result array
        int[] ans = new int[nums1.length];
        int i = 0;

        // Iterate through nums1 and find the next greater element for each element in nums1 using the map
        for(int v : nums1) {
            ans[i++] = map.get(v);
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```

*   **`Stack<Integer> st = new Stack<>();`**: Creates a new stack to store integers. This stack will be used to find the next greater element.
*   **`HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();`**: Creates a new hash map to store the next greater element for each number in `nums2`.
*   **`for(int i = nums2.length-1 ; i>=0 ; i--)`**:  This loop iterates through `nums2` from right to left. This is crucial for the stack-based approach.
*   **`while(!st.isEmpty() && nums2[i]>=st.peek()) st.pop();`**:  This `while` loop is the core of the stack logic.  It pops elements from the stack as long as the stack is not empty *and* the current element `nums2[i]` is greater than or equal to the element at the top of the stack (`st.peek()`). This step ensures that the stack maintains a decreasing order.  An element on the stack can only be a *potential* next greater element for elements to its left. If we encounter an element that's greater than or equal to the stack top, the stack top can no longer be a next greater element to *anything* seen so far.
*   **`if(st.isEmpty()) map.put(nums2[i] , -1); else map.put(nums2[i] , st.peek());`**: After the `while` loop, if the stack is empty, it means there is no greater element to the right of `nums2[i]` in `nums2`. Otherwise, the top of the stack contains the next greater element. The `map` is then updated with the next greater element for `nums2[i]`.
*   **`st.push(nums2[i]);`**: Pushes the current element `nums2[i]` onto the stack.  This element is now a potential next greater element for elements to its left that will be processed later.
*   **`int[] ans = new int[nums1.length];`**: Creates the result array `ans` to store the next greater elements for the numbers in `nums1`.
*   **`for(int v : nums1) { ans[i++] = map.get(v); }`**:  This loop iterates through `nums1` and retrieves the next greater element for each number from the `map`. The result is stored in the `ans` array.
*   **`return ans;`**: Returns the `ans` array.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(m + n), where n is the length of `nums1` and m is the length of `nums2`.
    *   Iterating through `nums2` once takes O(m) time. While there's a `while` loop inside the `for` loop, each element of `nums2` is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.  Therefore, the amortized time complexity of this part is still O(m).
    *   Iterating through `nums1` once takes O(n) time.
    *   The `map.get()` operation takes O(1) on average.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(m), where m is the length of `nums2`. This is because the `map` and the `stack` can potentially store all elements of `nums2` in the worst-case scenario. The size of the `ans` array is `nums1.length` so O(n), but since m can be larger than n, the space complexity is dominated by O(m).
