## Zero Array Transformation I - Detailed Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding

The problem asks whether we can transform a given array `nums` into an array of all zeros by applying a series of operations defined by `queries`. Each query `[l, r]` represents an operation that subtracts 1 from all elements in the subarray `nums[l...r]`.  We need to determine if, after applying all the operations specified by the queries, all elements in the original array `nums` can become zero or negative.

### 2. Approach / Intuition

The core idea is to efficiently track the net effect (number of times decremented) of the queries on each element of the `nums` array *without* actually modifying the array during query processing. We achieve this using the concept of **difference arrays**.

Instead of directly updating the `nums` array for each query, we use an auxiliary array `arr` (initialized with zeros) of size `n+1`. For each query `[l, r]`, we increment `arr[l]` and decrement `arr[r+1]`.  This represents the "starting" and "ending" points of the decrement operation.

After processing all queries, we calculate the prefix sum of the `arr` array.  The value `arr[i]` now represents the total number of times `nums[i]` was decremented by all the queries.

Finally, we iterate through the original `nums` array.  If `nums[i] - arr[i]` is ever greater than 0, it means that the element `nums[i]` was *not* decremented enough to become zero or negative. Therefore, it is impossible to transform the array to all zeros, and we return `false`. If we successfully iterate through the entire array without finding any such element, it means all elements can become zero or negative, and we return `true`.

The reason this approach is chosen is its efficiency.  Updating each element of `nums` for each query would lead to a time complexity of O(m*n), where 'm' is the number of queries and 'n' is the size of nums.  The difference array method allows us to process all the queries in O(m), calculate prefix sums in O(n), and make final comparisons in O(n). This brings the total time complexity to O(m+n), which is much more efficient.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms

*   **Arrays:** We primarily use arrays. The original `nums` array, the `arr` (difference) array and the `queries` array.
*   **Difference Array Technique:** The core algorithm used is the difference array technique for efficiently applying range updates (subtractions in this case).
*   **Prefix Sum:**  Calculating the prefix sum of the difference array converts it into an array representing the accumulated effect of all operations at each index.

### 4. Code Walkthrough

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isZeroArray(int[] nums, int[][] queries) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] arr = new int[n + 1]; // Difference array, size n+1

        // Process each query to update the difference array
        for (int[] q : queries) {
            int l = q[0], r = q[1];
            arr[l]++;        // Increment start of range
            arr[r + 1]--;    // Decrement after end of range
        }

        // Convert the difference array to an array representing total decrements for each index
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] += arr[i - 1];
        }

        // Check if transformation to zero array is possible
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (nums[i] - arr[i] > 0) return false; // Element cannot be transformed to zero/negative
        }

        return true; // All elements can be transformed
    }
}
```

*   **`isZeroArray(int[] nums, int[][] queries)`:**  This is the main function that takes the `nums` array and the `queries` array as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the array can be transformed to all zeros.

*   **`int n = nums.length;`:** Stores the length of the input array `nums`.

*   **`int[] arr = new int[n + 1];`:** Creates a new array `arr` of size `n+1` to store the difference array.  The extra element is needed to handle the case where a query's right endpoint is the last element of `nums`.

*   **`for (int[] q : queries) { ... }`:** This loop iterates through each query in the `queries` array.

*   **`int l = q[0], r = q[1];`:** Extracts the left (`l`) and right (`r`) endpoints of the current query.

*   **`arr[l]++;`:** Increments the value at index `l` in the `arr` array. This indicates that starting from index `l`, the elements should be decremented.

*   **`arr[r + 1]--;`:** Decrements the value at index `r + 1` in the `arr` array. This indicates that the decrement operation should stop after index `r`.

*   **`for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) { arr[i] += arr[i - 1]; }`:** This loop calculates the prefix sum of the `arr` array.  After this loop, `arr[i]` will represent the total number of times element `nums[i]` was decremented.  Note that we only need to iterate up to `n-1` because `arr[n]` is only used internally in difference array calculation and not directly compared with `nums`.

*   **`for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { ... }`:** This loop iterates through the original `nums` array.

*   **`if (nums[i] - arr[i] > 0) return false;`:** Checks if the element `nums[i]` can be transformed to zero or a negative number. If `nums[i] - arr[i]` is greater than 0, it means that the total decrement `arr[i]` is not enough to make `nums[i]` zero or negative. In that case, we cannot transform the array to all zeros, and we immediately return `false`.

*   **`return true;`:** If the loop completes without finding any element that cannot be transformed, it means that all elements can be transformed to zero or negative, and we return `true`.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity

*   **Time Complexity:** O(m + n), where 'm' is the number of queries and 'n' is the length of the `nums` array.
    *   The first loop (processing queries) takes O(m) time.
    *   The second loop (prefix sum calculation) takes O(n) time.
    *   The third loop (checking for transformability) takes O(n) time.
    *   Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(m + n).

*   **Space Complexity:** O(n).
    *   The only extra space used is the `arr` array, which has a size of `n + 1`.
    *   Therefore, the space complexity is O(n).
