### Problem Understanding

The problem, titled "The Two Sneaky Numbers of Digitville", presents us with an integer array `nums`. The structure of this array is very specific:
1.  It contains all integers from `0` up to `n-1` exactly once.
2.  In addition to these `n` unique numbers, there are two *other* distinct numbers that also fall within the range `[0, n-1]` and appear twice in the array.
3.  Consequently, the total length of the `nums` array will be `n + 2`.

Our goal is to identify and return these two "sneaky" numbers that appear twice.

For example, if `nums = [0, 1, 2, 2, 1]`:
*   `nums.length` is 5.
*   From `nums.length - 2`, we deduce `n = 5 - 2 = 3`.
*   This means the expected unique numbers are `0, 1, 2`.
*   The array contains `0`, `1`, `2`, and then `1` and `2` again.
*   The "sneaky" numbers are `1` and `2`.

### Approach / Intuition

The most straightforward way to find numbers that appear a certain number of times (in this case, twice) is to count their occurrences. Since the problem specifies that the numbers are within a known, contiguous range (from `0` to `n-1`), we can leverage a frequency array (also known as a counting array or a direct-address table).

Here's the high-level strategy:
1.  **Determine the range:** First, figure out the upper bound `n-1` for the numbers. The problem statement implies `nums.length - 2` gives us `n`.
2.  **Initialize a frequency counter:** Create an array (let's call it `map`) of size `n`. Each index `i` in `map` will represent the number `i`, and its value `map[i]` will store how many times `i` appears in `nums`.
3.  **Populate the frequency counter:** Iterate through the input `nums` array. For each number encountered, increment its corresponding count in the `map` array.
4.  **Identify duplicates:** After counting all numbers, iterate through the `map` array from index `0` to `n-1`. If `map[i]` is exactly `2`, it means the number `i` is one of our "sneaky" numbers that appeared twice. Store these numbers.
5.  **Return the results:** Since we know there are exactly two such numbers, we collect them and return them.

**Why this approach?**
*   **Known Bounded Range:** The numbers are constrained to `[0, n-1]`. This makes a simple array a perfect and highly efficient hash map, where the number itself is the key (index) and the value is its count.
*   **Efficiency:** Direct array access for counting is O(1), leading to a very fast solution.
*   **Simplicity:** The logic is intuitive and easy to implement.

### Data Structures and Algorithms

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `int[] map`: An integer array used as a frequency map (or counting array). The index `i` stores the frequency of the number `i`.
    *   `int[] ans`: A small integer array of size 2 to store the final result.

*   **Algorithms:**
    *   **Frequency Counting (or Counting Sort principle):** The core algorithm involves iterating through the input array to count the occurrences of each element.
    *   **Linear Scan:** After populating the frequency map, a linear scan of the `map` array is performed to identify elements with a specific frequency (in this case, 2).

### Code Walkthrough

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] getSneakyNumbers(int[] nums) {
        // 1. Calculate 'n' based on the problem's structure.
        // 'nums.length' is (n + 2) because there are 'n' unique numbers (0 to n-1)
        // plus two additional duplicate numbers.
        // So, n = nums.length - 2. This 'n' also defines the upper bound of numbers (n-1).
        int n = nums.length - 2;

        // 2. Initialize a frequency map (counting array).
        // The array 'map' will store counts for numbers from 0 to n-1.
        // map[i] will hold the frequency of number 'i'.
        int[] map = new int[n];

        // 3. Initialize the result array and an index for it.
        // 'ans' will store the two sneaky numbers.
        // 'ind' will help populate 'ans' sequentially.
        int[] ans = new int[2];
        int ind = 0;

        // 4. Populate the frequency map.
        // Iterate through each number 'v' in the input array 'nums'.
        // For each 'v', increment its count in the 'map' array.
        // Example: if nums = [0, 1, 2, 2, 1],
        // map[0] becomes 1
        // map[1] becomes 1, then 2
        // map[2] becomes 1, then 2
        for (int v : nums) {
            map[v]++;
        }

        // 5. Find the numbers that appeared twice.
        // Iterate from 0 up to n-1 (the range of possible numbers).
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // If the count of number 'i' in 'map' is exactly 2,
            // it means 'i' is one of the sneaky numbers.
            if (map[i] == 2) {
                // Add 'i' to our 'ans' array and then increment 'ind'.
                // Since there are exactly two such numbers, this will execute twice,
                // filling ans[0] and ans[1].
                ans[ind++] = i;
            }
        }

        // 6. Return the array containing the two sneaky numbers.
        return ans;
    }
}
```

### Time and Space Complexity

*   **Time Complexity:**
    *   `int n = nums.length - 2;`: This is a constant time operation, **O(1)**.
    *   `int[] map = new int[n];`: Initializing an array of size `n` takes **O(n)** time.
    *   `for (int v : nums) map[v]++;`: This loop iterates `nums.length` times. Since `nums.length = n + 2`, this is **O(n+2)**, which simplifies to **O(n)**. Each array access and increment operation inside the loop is O(1).
    *   `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { ... }`: This loop iterates `n` times. Each operation (array access, comparison, assignment) is O(1). So, this is **O(n)**.
    *   Combining these, the dominant operations are the two linear loops and the array initialization, all proportional to `n`. Therefore, the total time complexity is **O(n)**.

*   **Space Complexity:**
    *   `int[] map = new int[n];`: This array requires space proportional to `n` to store the frequencies. So, **O(n)** space.
    *   `int[] ans = new int[2];`: This array requires constant space, **O(1)**, as its size is fixed at 2 regardless of the input `n`.
    *   The `map` array is the dominant factor for space usage. Therefore, the total space complexity is **O(n)**.
