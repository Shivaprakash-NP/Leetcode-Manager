## LeetCode: Path Sum - Detailed Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The "Path Sum" problem asks whether a given binary tree contains a root-to-leaf path such that the sum of all node values along that path equals a specified target sum.  A root-to-leaf path is a sequence of nodes starting from the root and ending at a leaf node (a node with no children).

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution employs a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach using recursion.  This is a natural choice because DFS explores all possible root-to-leaf paths systematically.  For each node, it recursively explores its left and right subtrees, subtracting the current node's value from the remaining target sum (`rem`).  If a leaf node is reached and the remaining sum is zero, it means a path with the target sum has been found.

Why DFS?  Breadth-First Search (BFS) could also solve this, but DFS is often more concise and efficient for tree traversal when you need to explore all paths from the root.  The recursive nature of DFS neatly mirrors the tree's structure.

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:** The primary data structure is the binary tree itself (`TreeNode`).  No auxiliary data structures are explicitly used; the recursion manages the state implicitly through the call stack.
* **Algorithms:** Depth-First Search (DFS) is the core algorithm used. Recursion is the implementation technique for DFS.

**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **`TreeNode` class:** This is a standard definition for a node in a binary tree, providing `val` (node value), `left` (left child), and `right` (right child).

* **`Solution` class:** This class contains the solution logic.

* **`ans` variable:** A boolean variable that tracks whether a path with the target sum has been found. It's initialized to `false`.

* **`dfs(int rem, TreeNode node)` method:** This is the recursive helper function performing the DFS.
    * `if(node == null) return;`:  Handles the base case where a null node is encountered (end of a path).
    * `if(node.left == null && node.right == null && rem == node.val) ans = true;`: This checks if the current node is a leaf node (`node.left == null && node.right == null`) and if the remaining sum `rem` is equal to the node's value. If both conditions are true, a path with the target sum has been found, so `ans` is set to `true`.
    * `dfs(rem - node.val, node.left);`: Recursively calls `dfs` for the left subtree, updating the remaining sum (`rem`).
    * `dfs(rem - node.val, node.right);`: Recursively calls `dfs` for the right subtree, updating the remaining sum.

* **`hasPathSum(TreeNode root, int targetSum)` method:** This is the main method.
    * `dfs(targetSum, root);`: It initiates the DFS by calling the `dfs` helper function with the initial target sum and the root node.
    * `return ans;`: Returns the value of `ans`, indicating whether a path with the target sum exists.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree.  In the worst case, the DFS algorithm visits each node exactly once.

* **Space Complexity:** O(H), where H is the height of the binary tree.  This space complexity is due to the recursive call stack. In the worst case (a skewed tree), H could be equal to N, resulting in O(N) space complexity. In the best case (a balanced tree), H would be log₂(N), resulting in O(log₂(N)) space complexity.  Note that no auxiliary data structures are used beyond the implicit call stack.


This detailed explanation provides a comprehensive understanding of the provided Java code for solving the LeetCode "Path Sum" problem.  The solution is efficient and clearly demonstrates the effective use of DFS for tree traversal.
