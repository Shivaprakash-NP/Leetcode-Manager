## Valid Palindrome Problem and Solution Explained

Here's a breakdown of the provided Java code for solving the LeetCode "Valid Palindrome" problem.

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to determine whether a given string is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.  A palindrome reads the same forwards and backward. Non-alphanumeric characters should be removed, and the string should be converted to lowercase before checking for palindrome properties.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is to pre-process the input string to retain only alphanumeric characters and convert it to lowercase.  Then, we reverse the processed string and compare it with the original processed string. If they are identical, the original input string is a valid palindrome.

*   **Why this approach?**  This approach is straightforward and relatively easy to understand.  It directly addresses the problem constraints of filtering out non-alphanumeric characters and ignoring case sensitivity.  The use of `StringBuilder` for reversing the string is efficient.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `String`: The input string and the processed string are stored as `String` objects.
    *   `StringBuilder`: Used for efficiently reversing the processed string.  `StringBuilder` is mutable, making string manipulation faster than using immutable `String` objects.

*   **Algorithms:**
    *   **String Manipulation:** Using `replaceAll` to remove unwanted characters.
    *   **String Reversal:** Reversing the string using `StringBuilder.reverse()`.
    *   **String Comparison:** Using `String.equals()` to compare the processed string with its reversed version.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public static boolean isPalindrome(String s) {
        String ss = s.replaceAll("[^a-zA-Z0-9]" , "").toLowerCase();
        StringBuilder val = new StringBuilder(ss);
        String ans = val.reverse().toString();
        return ss.equals(ans);
    }
}
```

1.  **`class Solution { ... }`:** This defines the class `Solution`, which is a standard convention on LeetCode.

2.  **`public static boolean isPalindrome(String s) { ... }`:** This declares a public, static method named `isPalindrome` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a boolean value (true if `s` is a palindrome, false otherwise).

3.  **`String ss = s.replaceAll("[^a-zA-Z0-9]" , "").toLowerCase();`:** This is the crucial preprocessing step.
    *   `s.replaceAll("[^a-zA-Z0-9]" , "")`: This uses a regular expression to remove all characters that are *not* alphanumeric (a-z, A-Z, 0-9).  `[^a-zA-Z0-9]` matches any character that is not in the specified range. The second argument "" replaces those matched characters with an empty string, effectively removing them.
    *   `.toLowerCase()`:  This converts the resulting string to lowercase.
    *   The result is stored in the `ss` string.

4.  **`StringBuilder val = new StringBuilder(ss);`:** A `StringBuilder` object `val` is created using the processed string `ss`. `StringBuilder` is used because it's mutable, allowing efficient string reversal.

5.  **`String ans = val.reverse().toString();`:**
    *   `val.reverse()`: This reverses the string represented by the `StringBuilder` object `val`.
    *   `.toString()`:  This converts the reversed `StringBuilder` back into a `String` object and assigns it to the variable `ans`.

6.  **`return ss.equals(ans);`:** This compares the original processed string `ss` with the reversed string `ans`.  If they are equal, the input string is a palindrome (after processing), and the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`.
    *   `replaceAll` takes O(n) time in the worst case to iterate through the string and perform replacements.
    *   `toLowerCase()` also takes O(n) time.
    *   Creating a `StringBuilder` takes O(n) time.
    *   `reverse()` on a `StringBuilder` takes O(n) time.
    *   `equals()` takes O(n) time in the worst case.
    *   All other operations take constant time, O(1).
    *   Since the dominant operations are all O(n), the overall time complexity is O(n).

*   **Space Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`.
    *   The `ss` string stores the processed string, which can be at most the same length as the original string.
    *   The `StringBuilder` object `val` also stores a copy of the processed string.
    *   The `ans` string stores the reversed string, which also has a maximum length of n.

Therefore, the space used scales linearly with the size of the input string.
