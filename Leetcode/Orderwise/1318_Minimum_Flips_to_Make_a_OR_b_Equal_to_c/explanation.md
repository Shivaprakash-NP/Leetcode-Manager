## Minimum Flips to Make a OR b Equal to c: A Detailed Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the minimum number of bit flips required to make the bitwise OR of two integers, `a` and `b`, equal to a third integer, `c`.  A bit flip involves changing a 0 to a 1 or a 1 to a 0.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution uses a bitwise approach. It iterates through the bits of `a`, `b`, and `c` simultaneously, from the least significant bit to the most significant bit. For each bit position:

* **If `c`'s bit is 0:**  We need both `a`'s and `b`'s bits to be 0.  If either is 1, we need a flip to make it 0.
* **If `c`'s bit is 1:** We need at least one of `a`'s or `b`'s bits to be 1. If both are 0, we need one flip (it doesn't matter which bit we flip).

This approach is efficient because it directly examines each bit and determines the minimum flips needed at each position, avoiding unnecessary computations.

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

The primary data structure used is the integer itself, implicitly representing the bits. The algorithm employed is a bit manipulation algorithm using bitwise operators (`&`, `>>`) and a while loop for iterating through the bits.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

```java
class Solution {
    public int minFlips(int a, int b, int c) {
        int ans = 0; // Initialize the count of flips
        while(a!=0 || b!=0 || c!=0) { // Continue until all bits are processed
            int abit = a&1; // Extract the least significant bit of a
            int bbit = b&1; // Extract the least significant bit of b
            int cbit = c&1; // Extract the least significant bit of c

            if (cbit == 0) { // Case 1: c's bit is 0
                if (abit == 1) ans++; // If a's bit is 1, we need a flip
                if (bbit == 1) ans++; // If b's bit is 1, we need a flip
            } else { // Case 2: c's bit is 1
                if (abit == 0 && bbit == 0) ans++; // If both a's and b's bits are 0, we need a flip
            }
            c = c>>1; // Right shift c to process the next bit
            a = a>>1; // Right shift a to process the next bit
            b = b>>1; // Right shift b to process the next bit
        }
        return ans; // Return the total number of flips
    }
}
```

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(log(max(a, b, c))). The `while` loop iterates at most 32 times (for 32-bit integers), which is logarithmic with respect to the input values.  The bitwise operations inside the loop are constant time.

* **Space Complexity:** O(1). The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space to store variables like `ans`, `abit`, `bbit`, and `cbit`.  No additional data structures are used that scale with the input size.


This solution efficiently solves the problem using a straightforward bitwise approach, offering optimal time and space complexity.  The code is concise and easy to understand, making it an ideal solution for this LeetCode problem.
