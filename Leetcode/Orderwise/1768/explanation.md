### 1. Intuition

The problem asks us to merge two strings, `word1` and `word2`, alternately.  Imagine you have two lines of people, one for `word1` and one for `word1`. You want to form a single line by taking one person from the `word1` line, then one from the `word2` line, and so on, until one line is empty.  Then, you add the remaining people from the non-empty line to the end. This code implements this exact process, character by character.


### 2. Approach

The solution uses three pointers and a `StringBuilder`.

1. **Initialization:** A `StringBuilder` called `sb` is created to efficiently build the merged string. Two integer pointers, `l` and `r`, are initialized to 0.  `l` will track the index for `word1`, and `r` will track the index for `word2`.

2. **Alternating Merge:** A `while` loop continues as long as both `l` and `r` are within the bounds of their respective strings (`l < word1.length()` and `r < word2.length()`). Inside the loop:
    - The character at index `l` of `word1` is appended to `sb`.
    - The character at index `r` of `word2` is appended to `sb`.
    - `l` and `r` are incremented to move to the next characters in each string.

3. **Handling Remaining Characters:** After the first loop, one of the strings might have remaining characters. Two separate `while` loops handle this:
    - The first loop appends any remaining characters from `word1` to `sb` if `l` is still less than `word1.length()`.
    - The second loop appends any remaining characters from `word2` to `sb` if `r` is still less than `word2.length()`.

4. **Return Value:** Finally, the `toString()` method of `StringBuilder` converts the built string to a regular `String`, which is then returned.


### 3. Data Structures

- **`StringBuilder`:** This is a mutable sequence of characters. It's used to efficiently build the merged string because appending to a `StringBuilder` is faster than repeatedly concatenating strings using the `+` operator.  This is crucial for larger input strings.
- **`int l`, `int r`:** These integer variables act as pointers or indices, keeping track of the current position being processed in `word1` and `word2` respectively.


### 4. Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(m + n), where m is the length of `word1` and n is the length of `word2`. This is because we iterate through each string at most once.  The `while` loops ensure we process each character exactly once.

- **Space Complexity:** O(m + n).  The space used is dominated by the `StringBuilder`. In the worst case, the `StringBuilder` will hold the entire merged string, which has a length of m + n. The integer variables `l` and `r` consume constant space, O(1).  Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(m + n).
