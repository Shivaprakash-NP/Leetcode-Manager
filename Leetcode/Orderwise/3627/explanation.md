### 1. Intuition

Imagine you have a pile of rocks, and you want to find the maximum sum of the weights of the *middle* three rocks after discarding some rocks.  This problem is similar. We're looking for the maximum sum of the medians of subsequences of size 3.  However, instead of searching through all possible subsequences (which would be computationally expensive), we realize that the largest values contribute most heavily to a high median sum.  Our approach cleverly uses a priority queue to efficiently identify and utilize these largest values.


### 2. Approach

The solution uses a priority queue (`PriorityQueue`) to efficiently find the largest values in the input array. Here's a breakdown of the algorithm:

1. **Initialization:** A max-heap priority queue `q` is created.  A max-heap orders elements with the largest element at the top.  This allows us to quickly access and remove the largest elements.

2. **Populate the Priority Queue:** The input array `nums` is iterated, and each element is added to the priority queue `q`.  This puts all the numbers in the queue, ordered from largest to smallest.

3. **Iterative Median Summation:**  The code calculates `n = nums.length / 3`. This determines how many times we need to remove elements to get to our target set of middle elements for the subsequences of size 3.  The loop `while(n-->0)` then repeats `n` times. In each iteration:
    - `q.poll();`: The largest element is removed from the priority queue.  We don't need the largest element as it won't contribute to the median of a subsequence of size 3.
    - `ans += q.poll();`: The next largest element (which is now the top of the queue) is added to the `ans` variable. This element *is* part of the middle element of a size 3 subsequence.

4. **Return the Result:** Finally, the function returns `ans`, representing the maximum median sum.


### 3. Data Structures

The core data structure used is a `PriorityQueue` (specifically, a max-heap). The max-heap ensures that the largest elements are always at the top, making it efficient to repeatedly remove the largest elements.  This is crucial for the algorithm's efficiency because it avoids the need to sort the entire array or explore all possible subsequences.


### 4. Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(N log N), where N is the length of the input array `nums`. This is dominated by the cost of adding N elements to the priority queue (O(N log N)) and removing 2 * (N/3) â‰ˆ 2N/3 elements (also O(N log N)).  The other operations are linear or constant time.

- **Space Complexity:** O(N). The space used is primarily due to the priority queue, which stores at most N elements in the worst case.  The other variables use constant space.  The `PriorityQueue` itself maintains a heap structure which in the worst case uses space proportional to the input size.
