## Longest Balanced Subarray I - Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem "Longest Balanced Subarray I" asks us to find the length of the longest subarray within a given integer array `nums` where the number of even numbers is equal to the number of odd numbers.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The provided code uses a brute-force approach to solve this problem.  The core idea is:

1. **Iterate through all possible subarrays:** We use nested loops to consider every possible subarray of the input array `nums`. The outer loop iterates from the starting index `i` of the subarray, and the inner loop iterates from `i` to the end of the array `n`, effectively expanding the subarray.

2. **Count even and odd numbers in each subarray:** For each subarray, we maintain two `HashSet`s: `e` to store even numbers and `o` to store odd numbers. As we iterate through the elements of the subarray, we add even numbers to `e` and odd numbers to `o`.  Using `HashSet`s ensures that we only count distinct even and odd numbers, but this doesn't influence the balanced subarray condition (the count of even numbers should equal the count of odd numbers, whether distinct or not).  A simple counter would have been sufficient.

3. **Check for balanced subarrays and update the maximum length:** After processing each element of the subarray, we check if the sizes of the `e` and `o` `HashSet`s are equal. If they are, it means the subarray is balanced (has the same number of even and odd numbers).  In this case, we update the `ans` variable with the maximum length seen so far.

Why this approach was chosen (or why it's a viable starting point):

*   **Simplicity:** The brute-force approach is the most straightforward and easy to understand.  It directly implements the problem's definition.
*   **Guaranteed Correctness (for small inputs):** It exhaustively checks all possible subarrays, ensuring that the correct answer is found.

However, it's important to recognize that brute-force approaches are often inefficient, especially for larger input sizes.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `int[] nums`: The input array of integers.
    *   `HashSet<Integer> e`:  Used to store even numbers in the subarray (though its uniqueness property is not strictly necessary).
    *   `HashSet<Integer> o`: Used to store odd numbers in the subarray (though its uniqueness property is not strictly necessary).
*   **Algorithms:**
    *   **Nested Loops:** Used for generating all possible subarrays.
    *   **Conditional Statements:** Used to check if a number is even or odd and to update the maximum length of the balanced subarray.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestBalanced(int[] nums) {

        int ans = 0; // Initialize the maximum length of the balanced subarray to 0
        int n = nums.length; // Store the length of the input array

        // Outer loop: Iterate through all possible starting indices of the subarray
        for(int i = 0; i<n; i++) {
            Set<Integer> e = new HashSet<>(); // Create a new HashSet to store even numbers for the current subarray
            Set<Integer> o = new HashSet<>(); // Create a new HashSet to store odd numbers for the current subarray

            // Inner loop: Iterate through the subarray starting from index i
            for(int j = i; j<n; j++) {
                if(nums[j]%2 == 0) e.add(nums[j]); // If the current element is even, add it to the 'e' HashSet
                else o.add(nums[j]); // If the current element is odd, add it to the 'o' HashSet

                if(o.size() == e.size()) ans = Math.max(ans, j-i+1); // If the number of even and odd numbers in the current subarray are equal, update the maximum length 'ans'
            }
        }

        return ans; // Return the maximum length of the balanced subarray
    }
}
```

*   `int ans = 0;`: This line initializes a variable `ans` to 0. This variable will store the maximum length of a balanced subarray found so far.

*   `int n = nums.length;`: This line stores the length of the input array `nums` in the variable `n` for efficiency.

*   `for(int i = 0; i<n; i++) { ... }`: This is the outer loop that iterates through all possible starting positions `i` of a subarray.

*   `Set<Integer> e = new HashSet<>();` and `Set<Integer> o = new HashSet<>();`: Inside the outer loop, these lines create new `HashSet`s named `e` (for even numbers) and `o` (for odd numbers). These `HashSet`s are reset for each starting position `i`.

*   `for(int j = i; j<n; j++) { ... }`: This is the inner loop that iterates through all possible ending positions `j` of a subarray starting at position `i`.

*   `if(nums[j]%2 == 0) e.add(nums[j]); else o.add(nums[j]);`: Inside the inner loop, this checks if the current element `nums[j]` is even or odd. If it's even, it's added to the `e` `HashSet`; otherwise, it's added to the `o` `HashSet`.

*   `if(o.size() == e.size()) ans = Math.max(ans, j-i+1);`:  This checks if the number of even numbers (the size of `e`) is equal to the number of odd numbers (the size of `o`). If they are equal, it means the subarray from `i` to `j` is balanced. Then, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the length of the current balanced subarray (`j - i + 1`).

*   `return ans;`: After the loops finish, this line returns the final value of `ans`, which represents the length of the longest balanced subarray found in `nums`.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n^2) where n is the length of the input array.  The nested loops iterate through all possible subarrays, and for each subarray, the code performs a constant amount of work (checking if a number is even or odd and comparing `HashSet` sizes).  Therefore, the time complexity is dominated by the nested loops, resulting in O(n^2).

*   **Space Complexity:** O(n).  In the worst-case scenario, the `HashSet`s `e` and `o` could potentially store all the elements of the input array (if all numbers in the array were distinct, either even or odd). Therefore, the space complexity is O(n). However, if the range of numbers in `nums` is constrained to be much smaller than n, and many of the numbers are repeated, the effective space used by the HashSets could be significantly lower.  The dominant space usage is technically tied to the distinct number of even and odd numbers found within *any* subarray. Nevertheless, since we consider all possible subarrays, the tightest upper bound remains O(n).
