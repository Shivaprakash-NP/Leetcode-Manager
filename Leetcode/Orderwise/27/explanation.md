### 1. Intuition

The problem asks us to remove all occurrences of a specific value (`val`) from an integer array (`nums`).  Imagine you're cleaning your desk: you want to remove all the papers with a specific label ("urgent"). You'd go through each paper, check its label, and if it's not "urgent," you keep it.  This solution uses a similar approach. We create a new list to store elements that we want to keep (those not equal to `val`), and then we copy these elements back into the original array.

### 2. Approach

The solution uses two loops and an `ArrayList` to achieve the removal.

1. **First Loop (Filtering):** It iterates through the input array `nums`. For each element, it checks if it's equal to the target value `val`. If it's *not* equal, it's added to the `ArrayList` called `ans`. This effectively filters out the unwanted elements.

2. **Second Loop (Overwriting):** This loop iterates through the original `nums` array *again*. It copies elements from the `ArrayList` `ans` into `nums`, filling the array from the beginning. Importantly,  if the `ArrayList` has fewer elements than the original array's length, the remaining positions in `nums` are filled with 0s. This ensures that the original array is properly modified.


3. **Return Value:** The function returns the size of `ans`, which represents the number of elements remaining after removing all occurrences of `val`.


### 3. Data Structures

- **`nums` (int[]):** The input array of integers. This array is modified in-place to remove elements.
- **`ans` (ArrayList<Integer>):** An `ArrayList` is used as a temporary storage to hold the elements that are not equal to the target value `val`. `ArrayList` is chosen because its size can dynamically increase as we add elements.  A simple array would require knowing the final size beforehand.

### 4. Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because we iterate through the array twice (once to filter and once to copy back).  Each loop has a time complexity of O(n), resulting in a total of O(n) + O(n) = O(n).

- **Space Complexity:** O(k), where k is the number of elements *not* equal to `val` (the size of `ans`).  In the worst case, k could be equal to n, meaning all elements are different from `val`, but it could also be much smaller.  The space used is dominated by the `ArrayList`, which stores at most k elements. Therefore the space complexity is O(k).  This is better than creating an entirely new array of size `n` to store the result (which would lead to O(n) space complexity).


**Improvements and Alternatives:**

This solution is correct but not the most efficient. A more optimized approach would use a two-pointer technique to perform the removal in-place in a single pass, resulting in O(n) time and O(1) space complexity.  This solution demonstrates a clear approach but has higher space complexity compared to more advanced techniques.
