## LeetCode: Course Schedule II - Detailed Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find a valid ordering of courses to take, given a set of prerequisites.  Each course has a number (0 to numCourses-1), and a prerequisite is represented as a pair (course, prerequisite), meaning course 'course' requires completing 'prerequisite' first.  If it's impossible to take all courses due to circular dependencies (e.g., A requires B, and B requires A), we return an empty array.  Otherwise, we return an array representing a valid course order.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

This problem is a classic topological sort problem. We use Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles and simultaneously build a topological ordering.  The key idea is that a node (course) can only be added to the topological ordering *after* all its dependencies have been added.  DFS helps us ensure this constraint.  If a cycle is detected during DFS, it means a valid order is impossible.

We chose this approach because DFS efficiently explores the graph of courses and dependencies. It directly allows us to detect cycles (which indicate an impossible order) and simultaneously construct the topological order by pushing nodes onto a stack once all their dependencies are processed.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * `ArrayList<Integer>[] adj`: An adjacency list representing the directed graph of courses.  `adj[i]` contains a list of courses that require course `i` as a prerequisite.
    * `boolean[] vis`: A boolean array to keep track of visited nodes during DFS.
    * `boolean[] path`: A boolean array to detect cycles during DFS. `path[i]` is true if node `i` is currently in the recursion stack.
    * `Stack<Integer> st`: A stack used to store the topological order of courses.

* **Algorithms:**
    * **Depth-First Search (DFS):**  Used to explore the graph, detect cycles, and build the topological order.
    * **Topological Sort:** The overall algorithm is a topological sort, which arranges nodes in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in a way that for every directed edge from node A to node B, node A appears before node B in the ordering.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **`dfs(int node, ArrayList<Integer>[] adj, Stack<Integer> st, boolean[] vis, boolean[] path)`:** This recursive function performs DFS.
    * `if(cyc) return;`:  This check short-circuits further processing if a cycle is already detected.
    * `vis[node] = true; path[node] = true;`: Marks the current node as visited and currently in the recursion path.
    * `for(int v : adj[node])`: Iterates through neighbors (courses that require the current course).
        * `if(!vis[v])`: Recursively calls `dfs` for unvisited neighbors.
        * `else if(path[v])`: If a visited neighbor is also in the current path, a cycle is detected (`cyc = true`).
    * `st.push(node); path[node] = false;`:  After exploring all neighbors, the node is pushed onto the stack (added to the topological order), and removed from the `path` array.

* **`findOrder(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites)`:** This function orchestrates the topological sort.
    * It initializes the adjacency list `adj`, the visited array `vis`, and the path array `path`.
    * The adjacency list is populated from the `prerequisites` array: `adj[c[1]].add(c[0])` adds an edge from `c[1]` (prerequisite) to `c[0]` (course).
    * It iterates through all courses, calling `dfs` for unvisited courses to perform DFS on each connected component of the graph.
    * `if(cyc) return new int[]{};`: If a cycle was detected, an empty array is returned.
    * Finally, it pops elements from the stack `st` to obtain the topological ordering and returns it as an integer array `ans`.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(V + E), where V is the number of courses (vertices) and E is the number of prerequisites (edges). This is because DFS visits each vertex and edge once.

* **Space Complexity:** O(V + E) due to the adjacency list (`adj`), the visited array (`vis`), the path array (`path`), and the stack (`st`).  In the worst case (a complete graph), the size of these structures would be proportional to V + E.  The size of the returned array is also at most V.

In summary, the provided Java code efficiently solves the Course Schedule II problem using Depth-First Search for topological sorting. The use of adjacency lists and a stack makes the algorithm performant and the code clear. The time and space complexities are optimal for this type of graph traversal problem.
