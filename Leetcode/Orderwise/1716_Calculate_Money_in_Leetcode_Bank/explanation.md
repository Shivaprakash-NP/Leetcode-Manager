### Problem Understanding

The "Calculate Money in Leetcode Bank" problem asks us to determine the total amount of money saved after $N$ days, following a specific deposit pattern:
1. The initial deposit on Monday of Week 1 is $1.
2. The deposit increases by $1$ each day (Tuesday is $2$, Wednesday is $3$, etc.).
3. The pattern resets weekly. Monday of Week $k$ starts with a deposit of $k$.

We need an efficient way to sum the deposits for $N$ days, accounting for the cumulative increases and the weekly resets.

### Approach / Intuition

The most straightforward (but inefficient) approach would be to simulate the deposits day by day, using an iterative loop. However, since the deposits follow a perfectly predictable arithmetic pattern, a highly efficient $O(1)$ mathematical solution is preferred.

The core intuition is to separate the total $N$ days into two components:
1. **Full Weeks:** The contribution from all complete 7-day cycles.
2. **Remaining Days:** The contribution from the last partial week.

Let $N$ be the total number of days.
We define:
*   $t = \lfloor N/7 \rfloor$: The number of full weeks completed.
*   $r = N \pmod 7$: The number of remaining days in the last partial week.

We then use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, $S = \frac{k(a_1 + a_k)}{2}$, to calculate the sum of deposits for both sections.

#### Full Weeks Calculation
The sum of money saved in Week $k$ is $28 + 7(k-1)$.
We need to sum this series for $k=1$ to $t$. This results in the sum:
$$S_{\text{full}} = \frac{7t(t+7)}{2}$$

#### Remaining Days Calculation
The $r$ remaining days fall into week $t+1$.
The starting deposit for this partial week is $t+1$.
The deposits are $(t+1), (t+2), \dots, (t+r)$.
This sum can be broken down into two parts:
1. A base deposit of $t$ for all $r$ remaining days: $r \times t$.
2. The standard sequential deposits $1, 2, \dots, r$: $\frac{r(r+1)}{2}$.
$$S_{\text{remaining}} = r \cdot t + \frac{r(r+1)}{2}$$

The total money is $S_{\text{full}} + S_{\text{remaining}}$.

### Data Structures and Algorithms

**Data Structures:**
*   Standard integer primitives (`int`). No complex data structures are required.

**Algorithms:**
*   **Arithmetic Series Summation:** The solution relies entirely on the pre-derived formulas for summing arithmetic progressions, making the calculation instantaneous regardless of $N$.
*   **Integer Division and Modulo:** Used to efficiently partition $N$ into full weeks ($t$) and remaining days ($r$).

### Code Walkthrough

```java
class Solution {
    public int totalMoney(int n) {
        // Calculate the number of full weeks (t) and remaining days (r)
        int t = n/7;
        int r = n%7;

        // The final return statement calculates the total sum using three terms:
        
        // Term 1: Sum of money from all 't' full weeks.
        // Formula: S_full = (7 * t * (t + 7)) / 2
        int term1 = ((7*t)*(7+t))/2;

        // Term 2 & 3: Sum of money from the 'r' remaining days in the partial week (week t+1).
        
        // Term 2: The constant base contribution for the partial week.
        // Since week t+1 starts with deposit t+1, there is a base increase of 't' dollars
        // applied to each of the 'r' remaining days.
        int term2 = r*t; 
        
        // Term 3: The standard sequential deposit (1, 2, 3, ... r) for the partial week.
        // Formula: Sum of integers from 1 to r = r*(r+1) / 2
        int term3 = ((r+1)*r)/2;

        return term1 + term2 + term3;
    }
}
```

### Time and Space Complexity

#### Time Complexity: $O(1)$
The solution involves a fixed, constant number of arithmetic operations (division, modulo, multiplication, addition, and assignment) regardless of the size of the input $N$. We do not use any loops or recursion dependent on $N$. Therefore, the time complexity is constant.

#### Space Complexity: $O(1)$
Only a few fixed-size integer variables (`t`, `r`, and the result of the calculation) are used. The memory usage does not scale with the input $N$. Therefore, the space complexity is constant.
