## Maximum Product of Two Digits Explained

Here's a detailed explanation of the Java code provided for the LeetCode problem "Maximum Product of Two Digits."

### 1. Problem Understanding

The problem asks us to find the maximum product that can be obtained by multiplying two *different* digits present in the given integer `n`.  If the largest digit appears more than once, we are allowed to multiply the largest digit by itself.

### 2. Approach / Intuition

The core idea is to find the two largest *distinct* digits in the given integer. We can achieve this by:

1.  **Finding the Maximum Digit:**  Iterate through the digits of the number to find the largest digit.
2. **Checking if the maximum digit appears more than once**: If it does, we can return the product of the maximum digit with itself.
3.  **Finding the Second Maximum Digit:** If the largest digit appears only once, we need to find the second largest digit (that is *not* equal to the largest digit).
4.  **Calculating the Product:**  Finally, return the product of the largest and second largest distinct digits.

This approach is efficient because it only requires iterating through the digits of the number a few times.  The direct approach of comparing all possible pairs of digits would be less efficient, especially for larger numbers.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms

*   **Data Structures:** No complex data structures are used. Simple integer variables are sufficient.
*   **Algorithms:** The algorithm relies on basic iteration and comparison operations.  We extract digits using the modulo operator (`%`) and integer division (`/`).  We use simple `if` statements for comparisons to find the maximum and second maximum digits.

### 4. Code Walkthrough

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProduct(int n) {
        int n1 = n; // Create a copy to avoid modifying the original input
        int m1 = 0; // Initialize the maximum digit to 0
        int m2 = 0; // Initialize the second maximum digit to 0
        int c = 0;  // Initialize a counter

        // First pass: Find the largest digit (m1)
        while(n1 != 0) {
            int d = n1%10; // Extract the last digit
            if(d >= m1) //If the digit is greater or equal to the largest digit so far
                m1 = d; // Update the largest digit
            n1/=10; // Remove the last digit
        }

        n1 = n;   // Reset n1 to the original value n
        //Second pass: check if the largest digit appears more than once
        while(n1!=0) {
            if(n1%10 == m1) c++; //Increment the counter if the digit is equal to the largest digit
            n1/=10; //Remove the last digit
        }

        if(c > 1) return m1*m1; //If the largest digit appears more than once, we can multiply it by itself, so return the product

        n1 = n; // Reset n1 to the original value n

        // Third pass: Find the second largest digit (m2)
        while(n1 != 0) {
            int d = n1%10; // Extract the last digit
            if(d > m2 && d != m1) // If the digit is greater than m2 and not equal to m1
                m2 = d; // Update the second maximum digit
            n1/=10; // Remove the last digit
        }

        return m1*m2; // Return the product of the largest and second largest digits
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   `n1 = n`:  Creates a copy of the input integer `n` so we don't modify the original.
    *   `m1 = 0`: Initializes `m1` to 0. This variable will store the maximum digit found.
    *   `m2 = 0`: Initializes `m2` to 0. This variable will store the second maximum digit found.
    *   `c = 0`:  Initializes `c` to 0. This variable will store the number of times the maximum digit appears.

2.  **Finding the Maximum Digit:**
    *   The first `while` loop iterates through the digits of `n1`.
    *   `d = n1 % 10`: Extracts the last digit of `n1` and stores it in `d`.
    *   `if (d >= m1) m1 = d`: If the current digit `d` is greater than or equal to the current maximum digit `m1`, update `m1` with `d`. This ensures that `m1` always holds the largest digit encountered so far.
    *   `n1 /= 10`: Removes the last digit from `n1` (integer division).

3.  **Checking if the largest digit appears more than once:**
    *   `n1 = n`: Resets `n1` to the original value of `n` for the next iteration.
    *   The second `while` loop iterates through the digits of `n1` again.
    *   `if (n1 % 10 == m1) c++`: Increment the counter `c` if the digit is equal to the largest digit `m1`.
    *   `n1 /= 10`: Removes the last digit from `n1` (integer division).
    *   `if(c > 1) return m1*m1;`: If the largest digit `m1` appears more than once, then we return `m1*m1`.

4.  **Finding the Second Maximum Digit:**
    *   `n1 = n`: Resets `n1` to the original value of `n` for the next iteration.
    *   The third `while` loop iterates through the digits of `n1`.
    *   `d = n1 % 10`: Extracts the last digit of `n1` and stores it in `d`.
    *   `if (d > m2 && d != m1) m2 = d`:  If the current digit `d` is greater than the current second maximum digit `m2` *and* `d` is not equal to the maximum digit `m1`, update `m2` with `d`. This ensures that `m2` always holds the second largest *distinct* digit.
    *   `n1 /= 10`: Removes the last digit from `n1` (integer division).

5.  **Returning the Product:**
    *   `return m1 * m2`: Returns the product of the maximum digit `m1` and the second maximum digit `m2`.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity

*   **Time Complexity:** The code iterates through the digits of the input number `n` at most three times. The number of digits in `n` is proportional to `log10(n)`. Therefore, the time complexity is O(log n).

*   **Space Complexity:** The code uses a fixed number of integer variables (`n1`, `m1`, `m2`, `d`, `c`).  The space used does not depend on the size of the input number.  Therefore, the space complexity is O(1) (constant space).
