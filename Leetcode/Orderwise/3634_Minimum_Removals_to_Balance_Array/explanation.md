## Minimum Removals to Balance Array - LeetCode Solution Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the minimum number of elements to remove from an array `nums` such that the maximum element in the remaining array is at most `k` times the minimum element.  In other words, we need to find the longest subarray where the ratio of the maximum to minimum element is less than or equal to `k`.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution employs a two-pointer sliding window approach combined with sorting.  Sorting is crucial because it allows us to efficiently find the minimum and maximum elements within a window. The algorithm iterates through the sorted array, expanding the window (`r`) as long as the condition `nums[r] <= k * nums[l]` holds (maximum is at most `k` times the minimum). When the condition is violated, the left pointer (`l`) is moved to shrink the window until the condition is met again. The longest valid subarray found is tracked, and the final answer is the total number of elements minus the length of this longest subarray (representing the elements that need to be removed). This approach is chosen because it efficiently explores all possible subarrays while maintaining the required condition.  A brute-force approach checking all subarrays would have a much higher time complexity.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**  The primary data structure is the input array `nums`.  No additional significant data structures are used beyond a few integer variables for pointers and lengths.
* **Algorithms:** The core algorithm is a two-pointer sliding window technique.  The `Arrays.sort()` method uses a highly optimized sorting algorithm (likely a variation of merge sort or quicksort) in Java's internal libraries.

**4. Code Walkthrough:**

```java
class Solution {
    public int minRemoval(int[] nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int len = 0; // Length of the longest valid subarray
        int l = 0;   // Left pointer of the sliding window
        Arrays.sort(nums); // Sort the array to easily find min and max within a window

        for(int r = 0; r<n ; r++) { // Iterate through the array with the right pointer
            while((long)nums[r] > (long)nums[l]*k) l++; // Shrink the window if the condition is violated. Note the use of long to prevent integer overflow
            len = Math.max(len, r-l+1); // Update the longest valid subarray length
        }

        return n-len; // Return the number of elements to remove
    }
}
```

* **`Arrays.sort(nums);`**: This line sorts the input array in ascending order. This allows us to easily track the minimum (at index `l`) and maximum (at index `r`) elements within the current window.

* **`for(int r = 0; r<n ; r++)`**: This loop iterates through the sorted array using the right pointer `r`, expanding the window.

* **`while((long)nums[r] > (long)nums[l]*k) l++;`**: This is the core logic. It checks if the condition `nums[r] <= k * nums[l]` (maximum <= k * minimum) is satisfied. If not, it moves the left pointer `l` to the right, shrinking the window until the condition is met. The use of `(long)` prevents potential integer overflow if `nums[r]` or `nums[l]` are large.

* **`len = Math.max(len, r-l+1);`**: This updates `len` to store the maximum length of a valid subarray encountered so far.

* **`return n-len;`**: This returns the minimum number of elements to remove, which is the total number of elements minus the length of the longest valid subarray.

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(N log N), dominated by the sorting step (`Arrays.sort()`). The sliding window part has a linear time complexity O(N) as each element is visited at most twice (once by `r` and once by `l`).

* **Space Complexity:** O(1). The algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space to store the variables `n`, `len`, `l`, `r`.  The sorting in Java's `Arrays.sort` might use a small amount of auxiliary space depending on the specific implementation, but it's typically considered O(log N)  or O(N) in the worst-case, which is still considered constant with respect to the input size in Big O notation.  In practice, the space used is negligible compared to the input array itself.
