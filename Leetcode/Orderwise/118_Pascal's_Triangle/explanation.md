## Pascal's Triangle Problem and Solution Explained

Here's a breakdown of the provided Java code that generates Pascal's Triangle, along with detailed explanations:

### 1. Problem Understanding

The "Pascal's Triangle" problem asks us to generate the first `numRows` rows of Pascal's Triangle. Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of numbers where:

*   The first and last number in each row is always 1.
*   Each number inside the triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

For example, if `numRows` is 5, the output should be:

```
[
     [1],
    [1,1],
   [1,2,1],
  [1,3,3,1],
 [1,4,6,4,1]
]
```

### 2. Approach / Intuition

The key idea is to build the triangle row by row, using the previously generated row to calculate the current row's elements.

*   **Base Case:**  The first row is always `[1]`.
*   **Iterative Construction:**  For each subsequent row, we initialize the row with 1s at the beginning and end. Then, for the inner elements, we use the formula: `current_row[j] = previous_row[j-1] + previous_row[j]`. This formula directly implements the property of Pascal's Triangle, where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

Why this approach? It's a straightforward, iterative way to construct the triangle based on its defining property.  It directly translates the mathematical definition into code.  We leverage the relationship between consecutive rows to avoid complex calculations.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms

*   **Data Structure:** `List<List<Integer>>` is used to represent the triangle.  This is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row in the triangle. `ArrayList` is the concrete implementation used because it provides dynamic resizing and efficient element access.
*   **Algorithm:** The core algorithm is an iterative process (using nested loops) to build the triangle row by row.  The formula `current_row[j] = previous_row[j-1] + previous_row[j]` is the heart of the Pascal's Triangle generation.

### 4. Code Walkthrough

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> generate(int numRows) {
        List<List<Integer>> triangle = new ArrayList<>(); // Initialize the triangle as a list of lists

        for (int i = 0; i < numRows; i++) // Iterate to generate each row (from row 0 to row numRows-1)
        {
            List<Integer> row = new ArrayList<>(Collections.nCopies(i + 1, 1)); // Create a new row with i+1 elements, all initialized to 1
            // Collections.nCopies(i + 1, 1) creates a list of size i+1, filled with 1s.  This ensures the first and last elements are 1.

            for (int j = 1; j < i; j++) // Iterate through the inner elements of the row (excluding the first and last)
            {
                row.set(j, triangle.get(i - 1).get(j - 1) + triangle.get(i - 1).get(j));
                // Calculate the value of the current element as the sum of the two elements directly above it in the previous row.
                // triangle.get(i - 1) gets the previous row.
                // triangle.get(i - 1).get(j - 1) gets the element to the left and above the current element.
                // triangle.get(i - 1).get(j) gets the element directly above the current element.
            }

            triangle.add(row); // Add the generated row to the triangle.
        }

        return triangle; // Return the completed Pascal's Triangle.
    }
}
```

**Detailed Explanation:**

1.  **`List<List<Integer>> triangle = new ArrayList<>();`**:  This line initializes an empty `ArrayList` named `triangle`. This list will store all the rows of Pascal's Triangle. Each element in the `triangle` list will itself be a `List<Integer>` representing a single row.

2.  **`for (int i = 0; i < numRows; i++)`**: This outer loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = numRows - 1`. Each iteration of this loop generates one row of the triangle. The variable `i` represents the row number (0-indexed).

3.  **`List<Integer> row = new ArrayList<>(Collections.nCopies(i + 1, 1));`**: Inside the outer loop, this line creates a new `ArrayList` named `row` to store the elements of the current row. `Collections.nCopies(i + 1, 1)` creates a list containing `i + 1` elements, each initialized to the value 1. This correctly initializes the first and last elements of each row to 1, as required by Pascal's Triangle.  The `ArrayList` is initialized with these values.

4.  **`for (int j = 1; j < i; j++)`**: This inner loop iterates from `j = 1` to `j = i - 1`. This loop calculates the values of the elements in the *middle* of the current row. It specifically excludes the first and last elements, because they are always 1 and were already initialized in the previous step.

5.  **`row.set(j, triangle.get(i - 1).get(j - 1) + triangle.get(i - 1).get(j));`**:  This is the core logic of the algorithm. It calculates the value of the element at index `j` in the current row (`row`) by summing the values of the two elements directly above it in the previous row (`triangle.get(i - 1)`).
    *   `triangle.get(i - 1)` retrieves the previous row (the row at index `i - 1` in the `triangle` list).
    *   `triangle.get(i - 1).get(j - 1)` retrieves the element at index `j - 1` in the previous row (the element to the left and above the current element).
    *   `triangle.get(i - 1).get(j)` retrieves the element at index `j` in the previous row (the element directly above the current element).
    *   `row.set(j, ...)` sets the value of the element at index `j` in the current row to the calculated sum.

6.  **`triangle.add(row);`**: After calculating all the elements of the current row, this line adds the `row` list to the `triangle` list.

7.  **`return triangle;`**: Finally, after the outer loop has finished generating all the rows, this line returns the complete `triangle` list, which represents Pascal's Triangle.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity

*   **Time Complexity:** O(numRows<sup>2</sup>).  The outer loop runs `numRows` times. The inner loop runs at most `numRows` times in each iteration of the outer loop. Therefore, the total number of iterations is roughly proportional to `numRows * numRows`, leading to O(numRows<sup>2</sup>) time complexity.

*   **Space Complexity:** O(numRows<sup>2</sup>). The space is used to store the triangle. The triangle has approximately `numRows * (numRows + 1) / 2` elements. Therefore, the space complexity is O(numRows<sup>2</sup>).
