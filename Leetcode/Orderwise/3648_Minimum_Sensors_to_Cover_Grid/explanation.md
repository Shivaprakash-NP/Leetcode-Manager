## Minimum Sensors to Cover Grid: LeetCode Problem Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem, "Minimum Sensors to Cover Grid," asks us to determine the minimum number of sensors needed to cover an `n x m` grid, given that each sensor covers a square area of size `(2k+1) x (2k+1)`.  The sensor's coverage is centered on its location.  We are to find the minimum number of sensors required such that every cell in the grid is covered by at least one sensor.  This is a problem of optimal sensor placement for complete grid coverage.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution uses a greedy approach. It assumes that the most efficient way to cover the grid is by placing sensors in a regular grid pattern. This approach significantly simplifies the problem. Instead of complex algorithms to find the optimal arrangement, it directly calculates the number of sensors needed based on the size of the grid and the sensor's coverage radius `k`.  The assumption of regular placement might not be the absolute minimum in all cases, but it provides a reasonably efficient and easily computable solution.

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

The solution primarily uses basic arithmetic operations.  No sophisticated data structures or algorithms are employed.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

```java
class Solution {
    public int minSensors(int n, int m, int k) {
        int cover = 2*k+1; // Calculate the side length of the sensor's coverage area.
        int row = (n+2*k)/cover; // Calculate the number of rows of sensors needed.  Ceiling division is implicitly used here.
        int col = (m+2*k)/cover; // Calculate the number of columns of sensors needed. Ceiling division is implicitly used here.
        return row*col; // Return the total number of sensors.
    }
}
```

* **`int cover = 2*k+1;`**: This line calculates the side length of the square area covered by a single sensor.  The sensor covers `k` cells to the left, `k` to the right, `k` above, `k` below, and the cell it's placed on.

* **`int row = (n+2*k)/cover;`**: This line calculates the number of rows of sensors needed.  The `(n+2*k)` part ensures that even if the grid's height isn't perfectly divisible by the sensor's coverage, enough sensors are included to cover the entire height. Integer division implicitly rounds down to the nearest whole number, effectively performing a ceiling operation because we are adding `2k` to account for edge cases.

* **`int col = (m+2*k)/cover;`**: This line mirrors the row calculation but for the columns.

* **`return row*col;`**: This line returns the total number of sensors needed, which is simply the product of the number of rows and columns of sensors.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(1). The solution involves only a few constant-time arithmetic operations.  The time taken is independent of the input size (n, m, k).

* **Space Complexity:** O(1). The solution uses only a few integer variables to store intermediate results. The space used is constant and does not depend on the input size.


**In summary:** The provided Java code offers a simple and efficient, though potentially not perfectly optimal, solution to the "Minimum Sensors to Cover Grid" problem. Its strength lies in its simplicity and constant time complexity.  A more sophisticated solution might explore dynamic programming or other optimization techniques to potentially find a lower minimum in certain edge cases where the greedy approach might be slightly less efficient.
