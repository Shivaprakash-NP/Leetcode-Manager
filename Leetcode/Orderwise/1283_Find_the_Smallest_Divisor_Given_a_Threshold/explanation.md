## Find the Smallest Divisor Given a Threshold - Problem Explanation and Solution

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to find the smallest positive integer divisor such that when we divide each number in a given array `nums` by this divisor and sum the rounded-up results, the sum is less than or equal to a given `threshold`.  In simpler terms, we're looking for the smallest divisor that keeps the sum of the rounded-up quotients within the specified limit.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The key insight is that the problem exhibits a monotonic property. As the divisor increases, the sum of the rounded-up quotients decreases. This allows us to use Binary Search to efficiently find the smallest divisor.

*   **Why Binary Search?** We can binary search over the possible range of divisors. The smallest possible divisor is 1, and the largest possible divisor is the maximum element in the input array `nums` (because dividing by anything larger than the maximum element will just result in 0 or 1 for each element).
*   **Monotonicity:**  If a divisor `d` results in a sum less than or equal to the threshold, then any divisor greater than `d` will also result in a sum less than or equal to the threshold. Conversely, if a divisor `d` results in a sum greater than the threshold, then any divisor smaller than `d` will also result in a sum greater than the threshold.
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  Initialize the left boundary `l` to 1 and the right boundary `r` to the maximum element in `nums`.
    2.  While `l <= r`:
        *   Calculate the middle divisor `m = (l + r) / 2`.
        *   Calculate the sum of rounded-up quotients using the divisor `m`.
        *   If the sum is less than or equal to the `threshold`, it means we can potentially find an even smaller divisor, so we update the right boundary `r = m - 1`.
        *   Otherwise, the sum is greater than the `threshold`, meaning the divisor `m` is too small, so we update the left boundary `l = m + 1`.
    3.  Return `l`.  After the binary search terminates, `l` will be the smallest divisor that satisfies the condition.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:**  The primary data structure is the input array `nums`.
*   **Algorithms:**
    *   **Binary Search:** This is the core algorithm used to efficiently search for the optimal divisor.
    *   **Iteration/Looping:**  Used to calculate the sum of rounded-up quotients for each divisor.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    private int is(int[] val , int m)
    {
        int ans = 0;
        for(int v : val) ans += (v+m-1)/m;
        return ans;
    }
    public int smallestDivisor(int[] nums, int threshold) {
        int l = 1;
        int r = Arrays.stream(nums).max().getAsInt();
        while(l<=r)
        {
            int m = (l+r)/2;
            if(is(nums , m) <= threshold) r = m - 1;
            else l = m + 1;
        }
        return l;
    }
}
```

*   **`is(int[] val, int m)` function:**
    *   This helper function calculates the sum of the rounded-up divisions.
    *   `int ans = 0;`: Initializes a variable `ans` to store the sum.
    *   `for(int v : val) ans += (v+m-1)/m;`:  This loop iterates through each number `v` in the input array `val`.
        *   `(v+m-1)/m`: This is a clever way to calculate the rounded-up division (ceiling). It avoids using `Math.ceil` which would require converting to `double`. This is equivalent to `Math.ceil((double)v / m)`.
            *   Adding `m-1` to `v` before dividing effectively rounds up the division.  If `v` is perfectly divisible by `m`, then `v % m == 0`, and `(v + m - 1) / m` will still be `v / m`.  If `v` is not perfectly divisible by `m`, then `(v + m - 1) / m` will be one greater than `v / m`, effectively rounding up.
    *   `return ans;`: Returns the calculated sum.

*   **`smallestDivisor(int[] nums, int threshold)` function:**
    *   `int l = 1;`: Initializes the left boundary of the binary search to 1 (the smallest possible divisor).
    *   `int r = Arrays.stream(nums).max().getAsInt();`: Initializes the right boundary of the binary search to the maximum value in the `nums` array. This represents the largest possible divisor we need to consider.
    *   `while(l<=r)`:  The main binary search loop continues as long as the left boundary is less than or equal to the right boundary.
    *   `int m = (l+r)/2;`: Calculates the middle divisor `m`.
    *   `if(is(nums , m) <= threshold) r = m - 1;`: Checks if the sum of rounded-up quotients using the divisor `m` is less than or equal to the `threshold`.
        *   If it is, it means we can potentially find an even smaller divisor that still satisfies the condition. So, we update the right boundary `r = m - 1`.
    *   `else l = m + 1;`:  If the sum is greater than the `threshold`, it means the divisor `m` is too small.  So, we update the left boundary `l = m + 1`.
    *   `return l;`: After the binary search loop finishes, `l` will be the smallest divisor that satisfies the given condition.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(N * log(M)), where N is the length of the `nums` array and M is the maximum value in the `nums` array.
    *   The binary search runs in O(log(M)) time, where M is the maximum value in `nums`. This is because the search space is from 1 to M.
    *   Inside the binary search loop, the `is()` function iterates through the `nums` array once, taking O(N) time.
    *   Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(N * log(M)).

*   **Space Complexity:** O(1).
    *   The solution uses a constant amount of extra space. The `is()` function uses a constant amount of space, and the variables `l`, `r`, and `m` also take up constant space.  The `Arrays.stream(nums).max().getAsInt()`  operation used to find the maximum value does not significantly affect space complexity.
