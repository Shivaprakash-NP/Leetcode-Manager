## LeetCode: Maximum Difference Between Adjacent Elements in a Circular Array

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the maximum absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in a circular array.  "Circular" means that the last element is considered adjacent to the first element.  We need to consider both differences between consecutive elements and the difference between the first and last elements.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution employs a straightforward linear scan approach.  Since we need to compare each element with its immediate neighbor (including the wrap-around from the last element to the first), a simple iteration through the array suffices.  There's no need for more complex algorithms like dynamic programming or divide and conquer because the problem's inherent structure is easily solvable with a single pass.  This approach is chosen for its simplicity and efficiency for this specific problem.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structure:** The primary data structure used is an array (`nums`) to store the input numbers.
* **Algorithm:** The algorithm is a linear scan (iteration) with a simple comparison to find the maximum difference.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxAdjacentDistance(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int ans = 0; // Initialize the maximum difference to 0.

        // Iterate through the array, comparing adjacent elements.
        for(int i = 1 ; i<n ; i++) {
            ans = Math.max(ans , Math.abs(nums[i-1]-nums[i])); //Update 'ans' if a larger difference is found.
        }

        // Consider the difference between the first and last elements (circularity).
        ans = Math.max(ans , Math.abs(nums[0]-nums[n-1]));

        return ans; // Return the maximum difference found.
    }
}
```

* **`int n = nums.length;`**: This line gets the length of the input array.
* **`int ans = 0;`**: This initializes a variable `ans` to store the maximum absolute difference.  We start with 0 because any difference will be greater than 0 (unless all elements are identical).
* **`for(int i = 1 ; i<n ; i++) { ... }`**: This loop iterates through the array, starting from the second element (index 1).  It compares each element with its preceding element (`nums[i-1]`).
* **`ans = Math.max(ans , Math.abs(nums[i-1]-nums[i]));`**: This line calculates the absolute difference between adjacent elements using `Math.abs()` and updates `ans` if this difference is greater than the current maximum.
* **`ans = Math.max(ans , Math.abs(nums[0]-nums[n-1]));`**: This line handles the circular aspect of the array, comparing the first and last elements and updating `ans` if necessary.
* **`return ans;`**: The function returns the maximum absolute difference found.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array. This is because the code iterates through the array once.
* **Space Complexity:** O(1). The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input size.  Only a few integer variables are used.  The space used is not dependent on the input array's size.
