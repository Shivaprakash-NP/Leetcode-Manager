## LeetCode: Maximal Square - Detailed Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the largest square containing only '1's within a given binary matrix (a matrix where each cell contains either '0' or '1').  The output should be the area of this largest square.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

This solution uses dynamic programming (DP) to efficiently solve the problem.  The core idea is to build a DP table (`dp`) where `dp[i][j]` represents the side length of the largest square whose bottom-right corner is at `matrix[i][j]`.

Why DP?  A brute-force approach would involve checking all possible squares within the matrix, leading to a very high time complexity.  DP allows us to avoid redundant calculations by leveraging previously computed results.  Once we know the size of the squares ending at positions above, left, and diagonally left-above, we can efficiently determine the size of the square ending at the current position.

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:** A 2D array (`dp`) is used to store the DP table.  The input is also a 2D array (`matrix`).
* **Algorithms:** Dynamic programming is the core algorithm used.  We also employ simple iteration to populate the DP table and find the maximum value.

**4. Code Walkthrough:**

```java
class Solution {
    public int maximalSquare(char[][] matrix) {
        int n = matrix.length;
        int m = matrix[0].length;

        int[][] dp = new int[n][m]; // Initialize the DP table

        // Initialize the first row and column of the DP table
        for(int i = 0; i<m; i++) dp[0][i] = (matrix[0][i] == '1')?1:0;
        for(int i = 0; i<n; i++) dp[i][0] = (matrix[i][0] == '1')?1:0;

        // Populate the rest of the DP table using dynamic programming
        for(int i = 1; i<n; i++) {
            for(int j = 1; j<m; j++) {
                if(matrix[i][j] == '1') {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j-1], Math.min(dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][j])) + 1;
                }
            }
        }

        // Find the maximum value in the DP table and return its square
        int ans = 0;
        for(int[] d : dp) for(int v : d) ans = Math.max(ans, v*v);

        return ans;
    }
}
```

* **Lines 5-6:** Get the dimensions of the input matrix.
* **Line 7:** Create the DP table with the same dimensions as the input matrix.
* **Lines 9-10:** Initialize the first row and column of the DP table. If a cell in the input matrix is '1', the corresponding cell in the DP table is set to 1; otherwise, it's set to 0.  This represents the base cases for the DP.
* **Lines 12-16:** This is the core DP logic.  It iterates through the rest of the matrix. If `matrix[i][j]` is '1', it means we can potentially extend a square. The size of the square is determined by taking the minimum of the sizes of the squares to its left, top, and top-left, and adding 1.
* **Lines 18-20:** This section iterates through the DP table to find the maximum value (`v`). Since `v` represents the side length, we square it (`v*v`) to get the area of the maximal square and update `ans` accordingly.
* **Line 22:** Returns the maximum square area.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(mn), where 'm' and 'n' are the dimensions of the input matrix. This is because we iterate through the matrix once to populate the DP table and once to find the maximum value.
* **Space Complexity:** O(mn). This is the space used by the DP table.


This dynamic programming solution provides an efficient way to solve the Maximal Square problem with optimal time and space complexity compared to a brute-force approach.  The use of the DP table cleverly avoids redundant computations, making the solution much faster for larger input matrices.
