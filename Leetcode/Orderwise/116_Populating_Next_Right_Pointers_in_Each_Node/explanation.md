## LeetCode: Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node - Detailed Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to modify a given perfect binary tree (a binary tree where all internal nodes have two children and all leaves are at the same level) so that every node's `next` pointer points to the node immediately to its right on the same level.  If a node is the last node on its level, its `next` pointer should be `null`.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution uses a level-order traversal approach, but cleverly avoids the use of a queue.  It iterates through the tree level by level. For each level, it connects the `next` pointers of the nodes. The outer `while` loop iterates until we reach a level where nodes don't have left children (meaning we've processed all levels). The inner `while` loop iterates across the nodes of the current level, connecting their `left` and `right` children.  This approach is efficient because it avoids explicit queue management, performing the connections in-place.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structure:** The primary data structure is the `Node` class representing the nodes of the binary tree.  We are modifying the tree in-place, so no additional data structures are needed beyond what's provided.
* **Algorithm:** The core algorithm is a modified level-order traversal.  It cleverly uses pointers to traverse the tree level by level and connect the nodes without explicitly using a queue.

**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* `class Node`: This class definition simply describes the structure of a node in the binary tree, including `val`, `left`, `right`, and `next` pointers.

* `class Solution`: This class contains the `connect` method.

* `connect(Node root)`:
    * `Node st = root;`:  `st` acts as a pointer to the starting node of the current level. It is initialized to the root.
    * `while(st != null && st.left != null)`: This loop continues as long as we have a starting node for the level (`st != null`) and that node has left children (`st.left != null`). This condition ensures we process all levels.
    * `Node cur = st;`:  `cur` is a pointer to traverse nodes within the current level.
    * `while(cur != null)`: This inner loop iterates through all nodes at the current level.
    * `cur.left.next = cur.right;`: This line connects the `next` pointer of the left child to its right sibling.
    * `if(cur.next != null) { cur.right.next = cur.next.left; }`: This line connects the `next` pointer of the right child to the left child of the next node on the same level.  The `if` condition handles the case where `cur` is the last node on the level.
    * `cur = cur.next;`: Move to the next node on the current level.
    * `st = st.left;`: After processing a level, the starting node for the next level becomes the left child of the starting node of the current level.
    * `return root;`: Returns the root of the modified tree.

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.  We visit each node a constant number of times (at most twice in the nested loops).
* **Space Complexity:** O(1). The algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space to store pointers (`st` and `cur`).  No additional data structures like queues are used, making it highly space-efficient.  This is a significant advantage over solutions that use level-order traversal with a queue, which would have O(W) space complexity, where W is the maximum width of the tree.


This solution provides an elegant and efficient way to solve the "Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node" problem, showcasing a clever use of pointers to achieve a linear time and constant space complexity.
