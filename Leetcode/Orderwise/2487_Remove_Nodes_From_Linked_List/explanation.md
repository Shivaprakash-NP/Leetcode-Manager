## LeetCode Problem: Remove Nodes From Linked List - Explained

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem requires us to remove nodes from a singly linked list where a node's value is less than a subsequent node's value.  Essentially, we need to iterate through the list and eliminate any node that's smaller than any of the nodes that appear *after* it in the list. The goal is to return the head of the modified linked list.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The key idea behind this solution is to reverse the linked list first. Why? Because by reversing the list, we can now easily iterate from the *end* to the *beginning* (original list's beginning to end).  This allows us to keep track of the maximum value encountered *so far*.  If we encounter a node with a value *less than* the current maximum, we remove it.

After processing the reversed list, we reverse it again to restore the original order (but with the smaller nodes removed).

This approach is chosen because:

*   It avoids nested loops or complex lookaheads, which would increase time complexity.
*   Reversing the list simplifies the process of identifying and removing nodes that violate the "greater than later" condition.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structure:** Singly Linked List (ListNode)
*   **Algorithms:**
    *   **Linked List Reversal:**  A standard iterative algorithm to reverse a singly linked list.
    *   **Linear Traversal:**  Iterating through the linked list to compare node values and remove nodes.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    private ListNode reverse(ListNode head)
    {
        ListNode pre = null;
        while(head != null)
        {
            ListNode nxt = head.next;
            head.next = pre;
            pre = head;
            head = nxt;
        }
        return pre;
    }
    public ListNode removeNodes(ListNode head) {
        head = reverse(head);
        ListNode s = head;
        while(s != null)
        {
            ListNode newnode = s.next;
            while(newnode != null && newnode.val < s.val) newnode = newnode.next;
            s.next = newnode;
            s = s.next;
        }
        return reverse(head);
    }
}
```

**`reverse(ListNode head)` Function:**

This function reverses a linked list.

1.  `ListNode pre = null;`: Initializes a `pre` (previous) pointer to `null`.  This will become the new head of the reversed list.
2.  `while(head != null)`:  The main loop iterates as long as there are nodes in the original list.
3.  `ListNode nxt = head.next;`:  Temporarily stores the next node in `nxt` to avoid losing it when `head.next` is modified.
4.  `head.next = pre;`:  This is the core reversal step.  The `next` pointer of the current node (`head`) is pointed to the previous node (`pre`).
5.  `pre = head;`:  The `pre` pointer is updated to the current node (`head`).
6.  `head = nxt;`:  The `head` pointer moves to the next node (`nxt`).
7.  `return pre;`: After the loop, `pre` will be the new head of the reversed list.

**`removeNodes(ListNode head)` Function:**

1.  `head = reverse(head);`: Reverses the input linked list.  Now, we can process it from end to beginning.
2.  `ListNode s = head;`: Initializes a pointer `s` to the head of the reversed list. `s` will be the node that's considered to have the current maximum value so far.
3.  `while(s != null)`: The outer loop iterates through the reversed linked list.
4.  `ListNode newnode = s.next;`: `newnode` points to the node after `s`.  This is the node we'll examine for removal.
5.  `while(newnode != null && newnode.val < s.val) newnode = newnode.next;`: This inner loop skips over nodes that are *smaller* than the current node `s`. The objective is to find the next node that is greater or equal to the value of current node `s`.
6.  `s.next = newnode;`: This step performs the removal (or rather, bypassing) of the smaller nodes. `s.next` now points to `newnode`.
7.  `s = s.next;`: Move on to the next important node, now being `newnode`.
8.  `return reverse(head);`: Reverses the linked list again to restore the original order and returns the new head of the list.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list.
    *   `reverse()` function takes O(N) time.
    *   The outer `while` loop in `removeNodes()` iterates through each node once.
    *   The inner `while` loop *may* iterate through some nodes multiple times in total. However, each node is only *skipped over* at most once. This can be considered amortized O(1) on average per outer loop iteration, making the entire `removeNodes()` function still O(N).
    *   The final `reverse()` function takes O(N) time.
    *   Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(N) + O(N) + O(N) which simplifies to O(N).

*   **Space Complexity:** O(1).
    *   The `reverse()` function uses constant extra space for pointers ( `pre`, `nxt`).
    *   The `removeNodes()` function also uses constant extra space for pointers (`s`, `newnode`).
    *   Therefore, the space complexity is O(1).  The algorithm operates in-place.
