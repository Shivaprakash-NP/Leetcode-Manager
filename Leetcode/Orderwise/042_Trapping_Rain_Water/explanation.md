## Trapping Rain Water Problem Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The "Trapping Rain Water" problem asks us to calculate the amount of rainwater that can be trapped between bars of varying heights in a given array representing an elevation map.  Imagine each element in the array as the height of a vertical bar, and rain is falling on this landscape.  The goal is to determine the total units of water that can be held between these bars.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is to realize that the amount of water that can be trapped at any position `i` is determined by the minimum of the maximum height to the left of `i` and the maximum height to the right of `i`, minus the height of the bar at `i`.  We can't simply precompute the `leftMax` and `rightMax` for each position using arrays because that would result in O(n) space complexity.

Instead, we use a two-pointer approach to dynamically calculate `leftMax` and `rightMax`. We maintain two pointers, `l` and `r`, starting from the leftmost and rightmost positions, respectively.  We also keep track of `lmax` (the maximum height encountered so far from the left) and `rmax` (the maximum height encountered so far from the right).

At each step, we compare `height[l]` and `height[r]`.

*   If `height[l] <= height[r]`, it means the current bar on the left side (`height[l]`) is smaller than or equal to the current bar on the right side (`height[r]`).  In this case, we only need to consider `lmax` when determining the water that can be trapped at position `l`.
    *   If `height[l] >= lmax`, it means we have found a new maximum height from the left, so we update `lmax`.
    *   Otherwise, the water trapped at position `l` is `lmax - height[l]`.
    *   We then increment `l` to move to the next position from the left.
*   If `height[l] > height[r]`, we do the same logic but from the right side, considering `rmax` and the position `r`.

This approach works because by comparing `height[l]` and `height[r]`, we can guarantee that the water trapped at either `l` or `r` is determined by the side with the smaller height, and the larger height can effectively serve as the 'boundary'.  The two pointers converge towards the middle, and we accumulate the trapped water along the way.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:**  The primary data structure used is an integer array (`height`) representing the elevation map.
*   **Algorithms:** The algorithm employed is a two-pointer approach.  It also incorporates the idea of dynamically maintaining the maximum value encountered from both ends of the array.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int trap(int[] height) {
        int n = height.length;
        int ans = 0;
        int l = 0;
        int r = n-1;
        int lmax = 0;
        int rmax = 0;
        while(l<r) {
            if(height[l] <= height[r]) {
                if(height[l] >= lmax) lmax = height[l];
                else ans += lmax - height[l];
                l++;
            } else {
                if(height[r] >= rmax) rmax = height[r];
                else ans += rmax - height[r];
                r--;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   `n = height.length;`: Gets the length of the `height` array.
    *   `ans = 0;`: Initializes the variable to store the total trapped water.
    *   `l = 0;`: Initializes the left pointer to the beginning of the array.
    *   `r = n - 1;`: Initializes the right pointer to the end of the array.
    *   `lmax = 0;`: Initializes the maximum height encountered from the left to 0.
    *   `rmax = 0;`: Initializes the maximum height encountered from the right to 0.

2.  **`while(l < r)` loop:**
    *   This loop continues as long as the left pointer is less than the right pointer.  This ensures we traverse the entire array.

3.  **`if(height[l] <= height[r])`:**
    *   Compares the heights at the left and right pointers.  If the height on the left is less than or equal to the height on the right, we process the left side.
    *   `if(height[l] >= lmax) lmax = height[l];`: If the current height on the left is greater than or equal to the maximum height encountered from the left so far (`lmax`), we update `lmax` to the current height.  This means no water can be trapped at this position because it's the highest we've seen so far from the left.
    *   `else ans += lmax - height[l];`: Otherwise, the water trapped at the current position `l` is equal to `lmax - height[l]`.  We add this amount to the `ans`. The water is trapped because the height `height[l]` is lower than the current left max `lmax`. The water cannot overflow because `height[l]` is also smaller than or equal to the `height[r]`, so the maximum height on the right is larger or equal to `lmax`.
    *   `l++;`: Move the left pointer one step to the right.

4.  **`else` block:**
    *   This block is executed if `height[l] > height[r]`. It mirrors the logic in the `if` block, but for the right side of the array.
    *   `if(height[r] >= rmax) rmax = height[r];`: If the current height on the right is greater than or equal to the maximum height encountered from the right so far (`rmax`), we update `rmax` to the current height.
    *   `else ans += rmax - height[r];`: Otherwise, the water trapped at the current position `r` is equal to `rmax - height[r]`. We add this amount to `ans`.  The water is trapped because the height `height[r]` is lower than the current right max `rmax`.
    *   `r--;`: Move the right pointer one step to the left.

5.  **`return ans;`:** After the loop finishes, the variable `ans` contains the total amount of trapped water, which is returned.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the `height` array.  The two pointers traverse the array only once.

*   **Space Complexity:** O(1). We use a constant amount of extra space to store variables like `ans`, `l`, `r`, `lmax`, and `rmax`. The space used does not depend on the input size.
