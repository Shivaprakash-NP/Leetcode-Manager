## Plus One: Detailed Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The "Plus One" problem asks us to take an array of digits representing a non-negative integer and increment it by one. The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list (index 0), and each element in the array contains a single digit.  We need to return a new array representing the incremented integer.  For example, `[1, 2, 3]` should become `[1, 2, 4]`, and `[9, 9, 9]` should become `[1, 0, 0, 0]`.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is to simulate manual addition, just like how we would add 1 to a number written on paper.  We start from the least significant digit (the rightmost digit in the array) and increment it.

*   **Case 1: No Carry-Over:** If adding 1 doesn't result in a carry-over (i.e., the digit becomes less than 10), we simply return the modified array.  For example, `[1, 2, 3]` becomes `[1, 2, 4]` in one step.

*   **Case 2: Carry-Over:** If adding 1 *does* result in a carry-over (i.e., the digit becomes 10), we set the digit to 0 and propagate the carry-over to the next digit to the left. This process continues until we either reach a digit that doesn't cause a carry-over or we reach the most significant digit.

*   **Special Case: Overflow:** If we reach the most significant digit and *still* have a carry-over, it means the number has increased in size (e.g., `[9, 9, 9]` becomes `[1, 0, 0, 0]`).  In this case, we need to create a new array that is one element larger than the original array, set the first element to 1 (the carry-over), and the rest of the elements to 0.

This approach is chosen because it directly mimics the fundamental process of incrementing a number, making it intuitive and efficient. We iterate through the array from right to left, so we know exactly what to do with the carry over from the previous number.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structure:** `int[]` (an array of integers) is used to store the digits of the number.
*   **Algorithm:** Iteration (specifically a `for` loop) is the primary algorithm used. It allows us to process each digit from right to left. This algorithm represents a simulation of manual addition.
    *   It also employs a form of "carry propagation" during the addition process, which is common in arithmetic operations.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] plusOne(int[] digits) {
        for(int i = digits.length - 1 ;i>=0;i--)
        {
            digits[i]++; // Increment the current digit
            if(digits[i]<10)
            {
                return digits; // If no carry-over, return the modified array
            }
            digits[i] = 0; // If carry-over, set current digit to 0 and continue

        }
        int[] newdigits = new int[digits.length+1]; // Create a new array if there's an overflow
        newdigits[0] = 1; // Set the first digit of the new array to 1
        return newdigits; // Return the new array
    }
}
```

1.  **`public int[] plusOne(int[] digits)`:** This is the method that takes the `digits` array as input and returns the modified `digits` array (or a new array in case of overflow).

2.  **`for(int i = digits.length - 1 ;i>=0;i--)`:**  This `for` loop iterates through the `digits` array from the last element (least significant digit) to the first element (most significant digit). `i` is the index of the current digit being processed.

3.  **`digits[i]++;`:** This line increments the current digit by 1.

4.  **`if(digits[i]<10)`:** This condition checks if the incremented digit is less than 10.
    *   If it is, it means there's no carry-over. We simply `return digits;` because the array now holds the correct incremented value.

5.  **`digits[i] = 0;`:** If the incremented digit is not less than 10 (i.e., it's 10), it means there's a carry-over. We set the current digit to 0.  The loop continues to propagate the carry-over to the next digit.

6.  **`int[] newdigits = new int[digits.length+1];`:** If the loop finishes without returning, it means we've reached the most significant digit and there's still a carry-over. This indicates an overflow. We create a new array `newdigits` with a length one greater than the original array.

7.  **`newdigits[0] = 1;`:**  We set the first element of the `newdigits` array to 1. This represents the carry-over that caused the overflow.  The remaining elements of `newdigits` will be implicitly initialized to 0.

8.  **`return newdigits;`:** We return the `newdigits` array, which now represents the incremented number.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of digits in the input array. In the worst-case scenario (e.g., `[9, 9, 9]`), we iterate through all the digits. In the best case (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`), we only iterate once. However, since we need to consider the worst case scenario, we can say the time complexity is O(n).
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1) in the average case, if no new array needs to be created. We are modifying the input array in place. In the worst case (e.g., `[9, 9, 9]`), we need to create a new array of size n+1, resulting in a space complexity of O(n).
