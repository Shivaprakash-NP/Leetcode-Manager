## Rotate List Problem Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The "Rotate List" problem on LeetCode requires us to rotate a given singly linked list to the right by `k` places. This means moving the last `k` nodes of the list to the front, while maintaining the relative order of the remaining nodes. If `k` is larger than the length of the list, we effectively rotate by `k % length`.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is to avoid actually performing `k` individual rotations. Instead, we can determine the new head and tail of the rotated list directly. Here's the breakdown of the approach:

1.  **Calculate Length:** First, we need to find the length of the linked list. This allows us to handle cases where `k` is larger than the list length.
2.  **Handle Edge Cases:** If the list is empty or has only one element, or if `k` is a multiple of the list length, no rotation is needed, and we return the original head.
3.  **Find the New Head:**  We use two pointers, `slow` (s) and `fast` (f). We advance the `fast` pointer `k` steps ahead.  Then we move both pointers simultaneously until the `fast` pointer reaches the end of the list. At this point, the `slow` pointer will be pointing to the node *before* the new head.
4.  **Rearrange the List:**  The node after the `slow` pointer will be the new head. We break the list at the `slow` pointer. Then, we connect the original head to the end of the original list.

This approach optimizes the solution by only traversing the list a limited number of times, making it more efficient than performing individual rotations.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structure:** Singly Linked List
*   **Algorithms:**
    *   Two Pointers (Slow and Fast)
    *   Modulo Operator (%) to handle `k` greater than list length
    *   List Traversal

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode rotateRight(ListNode head, int k) {
        // Edge cases: empty list or single-node list
        if(head == null || head.next == null) return head;

        // 1. Calculate the length of the linked list
        int len = 1;
        ListNode forlen = head;
        while(forlen.next != null)
        {
            forlen = forlen.next;
            len++;
        }

        // 2. Handle k greater than the list length using modulo
        k = k%len;
        // If k is a multiple of len, no rotation is needed
        if(k==0) return head;

        // 3. Use two pointers to find the new head
        ListNode s = head; // Slow pointer
        ListNode f = head; // Fast pointer

        // Move the fast pointer k steps ahead
        for(int i = 0 ; i<k ; i++)
        {
            f = f.next;
        } 

        // Move both pointers until fast reaches the end
        while(f.next != null)
        {
            s = s.next;
            f = f.next;
        }

        // 4. Rearrange the list
        ListNode newhead = s.next; // The node after slow is the new head
        s.next = null;             // Break the list at slow
        f.next = head;             // Connect the original head to the end of the list
        return newhead;           // Return the new head
    }
}
```

**Line-by-line explanation:**

*   `if(head == null || head.next == null) return head;`: Handles the edge cases where the list is empty or contains only one node. In these cases, no rotation is necessary.

*   `int len = 1; ListNode forlen = head; while(forlen.next != null) { forlen = forlen.next; len++; }`: This loop calculates the length of the linked list. `forlen` is a temporary pointer used to traverse the list.

*   `k = k%len;`: Takes the modulo of `k` with the list length. This ensures that rotations are performed within the list's bounds when k > len.

*   `if(k==0) return head;`: Checks if `k` is a multiple of `len`. If so, no rotation is needed, and the original head is returned.

*   `ListNode s = head; ListNode f = head;`: Initializes the slow and fast pointers to the head of the list.

*   `for(int i = 0 ; i<k ; i++) { f = f.next; }`: Advances the fast pointer `k` steps ahead of the slow pointer.

*   `while(f.next != null) { s = s.next; f = f.next; }`: Moves both the slow and fast pointers forward one node at a time until the fast pointer reaches the end of the list. At this point, `s` will be pointing to the node just before where the new head should be.

*   `ListNode newhead = s.next;`:  Sets `newhead` to the node after `s`. This node will be the new head of the rotated list.

*   `s.next = null;`: Breaks the original list by setting `s.next` to `null`.

*   `f.next = head;`: Connects the end of the original list (which is pointed to by `f`) to the original head. This completes the circular rotation.

*   `return newhead;`: Returns the new head of the rotated list.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list. We traverse the list twice: once to calculate the length, and once to find the new head and rearrange the pointers. Both traversals are linear in the size of the list.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1). The solution uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the size of the input list. We only use a few pointers to keep track of nodes during the rotation process.
