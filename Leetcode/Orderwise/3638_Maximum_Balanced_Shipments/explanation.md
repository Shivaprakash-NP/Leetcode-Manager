## LeetCode: Maximum Balanced Shipments (Improved Solution and Explanation)

The provided Java code attempts to solve a problem that could be interpreted as finding the maximum number of balanced shipments, where "balanced" implies some sort of equality in weight distribution. However, the current code is **incorrect** and doesn't effectively solve any meaningful "maximum balanced shipments" problem.  It simply counts the number of times a weight exceeds the previous maximum weight.  Let's assume the intended problem is to find the maximum number of shipments where the weights are as evenly distributed as possible (minimizing the maximum weight in any single shipment). This requires a different approach.  I'll first explain why the provided code is flawed and then present a correct solution.


**1. Problem Understanding (Corrected Interpretation):**

Given an array of package weights, we want to divide the packages into shipments such that the maximum weight of any single shipment is minimized.  The output should be the number of shipments required under this constraint.

**2. Approach / Intuition (Corrected Approach):**

The original code's approach is fundamentally flawed. A correct solution requires a binary search approach combined with a feasibility check.

* **Binary Search:** We'll perform a binary search on the potential range of maximum weights per shipment (from the maximum single package weight to the sum of all package weights).  The binary search helps us efficiently find the minimum maximum weight.

* **Feasibility Check:**  For each potential maximum weight (`maxWeight`) from the binary search, we'll check if it's feasible to create shipments with this maximum weight.  This involves iterating through the weights and creating shipments until we reach the `maxWeight` limit for each shipment.  If we successfully create all shipments without exceeding `maxWeight` in any, the `maxWeight` is feasible.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms (Corrected):**

* **Data Structures:**  The `weight` array (input) is used. No additional complex data structures are needed.

* **Algorithms:** Binary Search is the core algorithm.  The feasibility check uses a greedy approachâ€”packing as many packages as possible into each shipment before creating a new one.


**4. Code Walkthrough (Corrected Solution):**

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxBalancedShipments(int[] weight) {
        int maxWeight = 0;
        int totalWeight = 0;
        for (int w : weight) {
            maxWeight = Math.max(maxWeight, w);
            totalWeight += w;
        }

        int left = maxWeight;
        int right = totalWeight;
        int minMaxWeight = totalWeight; // Initialize with the worst case

        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (isFeasible(weight, mid)) {
                minMaxWeight = mid;
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        //Calculate the number of shipments needed with the minimum maximum weight
        int shipments = 0;
        int currentWeight = 0;
        for(int w : weight){
            if(currentWeight + w <= minMaxWeight){
                currentWeight +=w;
            } else {
                shipments++;
                currentWeight = w;
            }
        }
        shipments++; // Account for the last shipment

        return shipments;
    }

    private boolean isFeasible(int[] weight, int maxWeight) {
        int currentWeight = 0;
        for (int w : weight) {
            if (currentWeight + w <= maxWeight) {
                currentWeight += w;
            } else {
                currentWeight = w;
                if (w > maxWeight) return false; // Single package exceeds maxWeight
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

**5. Time and Space Complexity (Corrected Solution):**

* **Time Complexity:** O(N log W), where N is the number of packages and W is the sum of weights. The binary search takes O(log W) time, and the `isFeasible` function takes O(N) time in each iteration.

* **Space Complexity:** O(1). The solution uses only a constant amount of extra space.


**Why the Original Code Was Incorrect:**

The original code simply counts the number of times a weight is greater than the previous maximum.  This has no relation to minimizing the maximum weight in a shipment or finding the optimal number of shipments.  It doesn't consider the total weight or any strategy for grouping packages into shipments.  It completely misses the core logic of the "Maximum Balanced Shipments" problem.  It's a flawed solution to a poorly-defined or misunderstood problem statement.
