## Minimum Cost to Make at Least One Valid Path in a Grid - Solution Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the minimum cost to reach the bottom-right cell (n-1, m-1) of a grid from the top-left cell (0, 0).  Each cell in the grid contains a direction (1, 2, 3, or 4 representing right, left, down, and up respectively).  Moving in the direction specified by the cell has a cost of 0; moving in any other direction has a cost of 1.  We need to find the path with the minimum total cost.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a weighted graph.  The grid itself represents the graph, with each cell as a node. The edges are the connections between adjacent cells, and the weights are the costs of moving between them (0 if moving in the suggested direction, 1 otherwise).  We employ a deque (double-ended queue) to prioritize cells that can be reached with cost 0, ensuring we explore the most promising paths first (a variation of Dijkstra's to handle the 0-cost edges efficiently).

This approach is chosen because Dijkstra's algorithm is designed to efficiently find the shortest path in a graph with non-negative edge weights.  The use of a deque allows for a more optimized implementation, offering better performance than a standard priority queue in this specific scenario.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * `int[][] grid`:  The input grid representing the graph.
    * `int[][] distance`: A 2D array to store the minimum distance (cost) from the starting cell to each cell in the grid.  Initialized with `Integer.MAX_VALUE` to represent infinity.
    * `Deque<int[]> q`: A deque used to implement the priority queue in Dijkstra's algorithm.  Elements are stored as `[distance, row, column]`.
    * `int[][] map`:  A mapping array to quickly convert the direction number in the grid to its corresponding row and column offset.
* **Algorithms:**
    * **Dijkstra's Algorithm:**  A graph search algorithm used to find the shortest path in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights.
    * **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** The deque implementation functions similarly to a BFS, prioritizing 0-cost moves.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **Initialization:**
    * `n` and `m` store the dimensions of the grid.
    * `map` provides a quick lookup for direction vectors (e.g., `map[1]` is `{0, 1}` for moving right).
    * `distance` is initialized with `Integer.MAX_VALUE` except for the starting cell (0,0), set to 0.
    * The deque `q` is initialized with the starting cell `{0, 0, 0}` (distance, row, column).

* **Main Loop (while loop):**
    * The loop continues as long as the deque `q` is not empty.
    * `p = q.poll()` retrieves the cell with the smallest distance from the front of the deque.
    * The code iterates through the four possible directions (`dir`).
    * For each neighbor (`ni`, `nj`):
        * It checks if the neighbor is within the grid boundaries.
        * `c` calculates the cost of moving to the neighbor (0 if it's the suggested direction, 1 otherwise).
        * If the new distance (`dis + c`) is less than the current distance stored in `distance[ni][nj]`, it updates `distance[ni][nj]` and adds the neighbor to the deque.
        * Neighbors with cost 0 are added to the front using `q.addFirst()` to maintain the priority order.  Neighbors with cost 1 are added to the end using `q.addLast()`.

* **Result:**
    * After the loop finishes, `distance[n-1][m-1]` contains the minimum cost to reach the bottom-right cell.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(n*m), where n and m are the dimensions of the grid.  In the worst case, we visit every cell in the grid.  The deque operations (addFirst, addLast, poll) take constant time on average.

* **Space Complexity:** O(n*m).  The `distance` array and the deque `q` in the worst case can store all cells of the grid.  The `map` and `dir` arrays are of constant size.


In summary, this Java code efficiently solves the "Minimum Cost to Make at Least One Valid Path in a Grid" problem using a modified Dijkstra's algorithm with a deque for priority management, resulting in an optimal solution with O(n*m) time and space complexity.
