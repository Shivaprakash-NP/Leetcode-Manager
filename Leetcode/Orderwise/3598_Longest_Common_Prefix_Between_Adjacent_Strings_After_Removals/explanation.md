## Longest Common Prefix Between Adjacent Strings After Removals: Detailed Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the length of the longest common prefix for each string in an array, considering prefixes with its adjacent strings and also skipping one string in between.  The result is an array where each element represents the longest common prefix length for the corresponding string, considering its neighbors and the string two positions away.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution employs a dynamic programming-like approach.  It first calculates the longest common prefix (LCP) between each adjacent pair of strings. Then, it calculates the maximum LCP to the left and right of each string.  Finally, it considers the LCP between a string and the string two positions away to determine the final longest common prefix for each string. This approach is chosen because it efficiently handles the requirement of considering both immediate neighbors and the string two positions away.  A brute-force approach checking all combinations would be significantly less efficient.

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * `String[] words`: Input array of strings.
    * `int[] prefix`: Array to store the LCP of adjacent strings.
    * `int[] skipPrefix`: Array to store the LCP skipping one string.
    * `int[] lmax`: Array to store the maximum LCP to the left of each string.
    * `int[] rmax`: Array to store the maximum LCP to the right of each string.
    * `int[] res`: Array to store the final result.

* **Algorithms:**
    *  `getLCP()`: A helper function using a simple iterative approach to find the LCP of two strings.
    *  Dynamic Programming principles (implicitly): The code calculates prefix values and then uses them to efficiently compute the maximum left and right prefixes, avoiding redundant calculations.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **`getLCP(String a, String b)`:** This function calculates the length of the longest common prefix between strings `a` and `b`. It iterates through the strings character by character until a mismatch is found or the end of the shorter string is reached.

* **`longestCommonPrefix(String[] words)`:**
    * **Initialization:** It handles the base cases (arrays with 0 or 1 elements) and initializes arrays `prefix`, `skipPrefix`, `lmax`, and `rmax` to store intermediate results.
    * **`prefix` Calculation:**  It iterates through the `words` array and computes the LCP between each adjacent pair, storing the results in `prefix`.
    * **`skipPrefix` Calculation:** It calculates the LCP between strings separated by one string, storing the results in `skipPrefix`.
    * **`lmax` and `rmax` Calculation:** These two loops compute the maximum LCP to the left and right of each string respectively using a dynamic programming approach to efficiently find the maximum LCP.
    * **Result Calculation:** The code iterates through the strings again.  For each string, it considers:
        * The LCP with its neighbors (`lmax` and `rmax`).
        * The LCP skipping one string (`skipPrefix`).
        * It takes the maximum of these three values to obtain the final LCP for that string, storing it in `res`.
    * **Return Value:** It returns the `res` array containing the LCP for each string.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(N*M), where N is the number of strings and M is the maximum length of a string. This is because the `getLCP` function has a time complexity of O(M) in the worst case, and it's called O(N) times.  The remaining parts of the `longestCommonPrefix` function have a linear time complexity O(N).

* **Space Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of strings. This is due to the arrays `prefix`, `skipPrefix`, `lmax`, `rmax`, and `res`, each of which has a size proportional to N.  The space used by the input array is not considered in the space complexity analysis.


**In summary:** The code provides an efficient solution to the problem by cleverly using dynamic programming concepts to avoid redundant calculations.  The use of helper functions improves code readability and maintainability.  The time and space complexity are reasonably good, making it a suitable solution for the given problem.
