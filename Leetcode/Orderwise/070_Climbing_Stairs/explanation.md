## Climbing Stairs - Detailed Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The "Climbing Stairs" problem asks us to find the number of distinct ways to climb to the top of a staircase with `n` steps. We can either climb 1 or 2 steps at a time.  The problem essentially asks: Given `n`, how many different combinations of 1's and 2's sum up to `n`?

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is to recognize that this problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming.  Let `dp[i]` represent the number of ways to reach the `i`-th step. To reach the `i`-th step, we can either take a single step from the `(i-1)`-th step or a double step from the `(i-2)`-th step.  Therefore, the number of ways to reach the `i`-th step is the sum of the number of ways to reach the `(i-1)`-th step and the number of ways to reach the `(i-2)`-th step.

This leads to the recurrence relation: `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]`.

Why Dynamic Programming?  Because the number of ways to reach a particular step depends on the number of ways to reach the preceding steps. This overlapping subproblems characteristic makes DP a good choice, allowing us to store and reuse intermediate results, avoiding redundant calculations. In essence, this problem demonstrates a Fibonacci sequence pattern.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structure:** An integer array `dp` of size `n` is used to store the number of ways to reach each step.
*   **Algorithm:** Dynamic Programming with a bottom-up approach. We build the `dp` array from the base cases (step 1 and step 2) to the final destination (step `n`).

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        if(n == 1) return 1;
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        dp[0] = 1;
        dp[1] = 2;
        for(int i = 2; i<n; i++) dp[i] = dp[i-1]+dp[i-2];
        return dp[n-1];
    }
}
```

1.  **`class Solution { ... }`**: This defines a class named `Solution` that contains the `climbStairs` method.

2.  **`public int climbStairs(int n) { ... }`**:  This is the method that solves the problem. It takes an integer `n` (the number of steps) as input and returns an integer representing the number of ways to climb the stairs.

3.  **`if(n == 1) return 1;`**: This is the base case. If there is only 1 step, there's only 1 way to climb it.

4.  **`int[] dp = new int[n];`**: An integer array `dp` of size `n` is created.  `dp[i]` will store the number of ways to reach step `i+1`.

5.  **`dp[0] = 1;`**: This initializes the base case for `dp`. `dp[0]` represents the number of ways to reach the first step (which is 1).

6.  **`dp[1] = 2;`**: This initializes the second base case. `dp[1]` represents the number of ways to reach the second step (which is 2: either two single steps or one double step).

7.  **`for(int i = 2; i<n; i++) dp[i] = dp[i-1]+dp[i-2];`**: This is the dynamic programming step.  It iterates from the 3rd step up to the `n`-th step.  For each step `i`, it calculates the number of ways to reach it by summing the number of ways to reach the previous step (`dp[i-1]`) and the step before that (`dp[i-2]`).

8.  **`return dp[n-1];`**: Finally, the method returns `dp[n-1]`, which represents the number of ways to reach the `n`-th step (the top of the staircase).

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n). The `for` loop iterates `n-2` times, performing a constant amount of work in each iteration. Therefore, the time complexity is linear with respect to `n`.

*   **Space Complexity:** O(n). The `dp` array stores `n` integers. Thus, the space complexity is also linear with respect to `n`.

It's possible to optimize the space complexity to O(1) by only storing the previous two values in the `dp` calculation since we only need `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]` to compute `dp[i]`.  However, the given code uses O(n) space.
