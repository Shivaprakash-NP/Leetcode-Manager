## LeetCode: Network Delay Time - Solution Explained

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the minimum time it takes for a signal to reach all nodes in a network.  We're given a list of `times`, where each `times[i] = [u, v, w]` represents a directed edge from node `u` to node `v` with weight `w` (the time it takes to traverse the edge).  We are also given `n`, the total number of nodes (1-indexed), and `k`, the starting node.  The goal is to determine the maximum time it takes to reach all nodes from node `k`, or -1 if it's impossible to reach all nodes.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

This problem is a classic shortest path problem.  Since we need to find the shortest path from a single source (`k`) to all other nodes, Dijkstra's algorithm is the ideal choice. Dijkstra's algorithm efficiently finds the shortest paths from a single source node to all other nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights.  A priority queue is used to optimize the selection of the node with the minimum distance at each step, ensuring efficiency.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**
    * `int[] dis`: An array to store the shortest distance from the source node (`k`) to each node. Initialized with `Integer.MAX_VALUE` to represent infinity.
    * `ArrayList<int[]>[] adj`: An adjacency list to represent the graph. `adj[i]` stores a list of edges originating from node `i`. Each edge is represented as `[neighbor, weight]`.
    * `PriorityQueue<int[]> q`: A priority queue to store nodes to be processed, ordered by their shortest distance from the source node.  This is crucial for the efficiency of Dijkstra's algorithm.

* **Algorithms:**
    * **Dijkstra's Algorithm:**  The core algorithm used to find the shortest paths.
    * **Priority Queue:** Used to efficiently select the node with the minimum distance at each step of Dijkstra's algorithm.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **Initialization:**
    * `int[] dis`: An array to store the shortest distance from the source node to each node, initialized to infinity.
    * `ArrayList<int[]>[] adj`: An adjacency list representing the graph is created and initialized.
    * `PriorityQueue<int[]> q`: A priority queue is created to store nodes and their distances, ordered by distance.


* **Graph Construction:**
    * The `for` loop iterates through the `times` array and adds each edge to the adjacency list.  Note the adjustment of indices (`e[0]-1`, `e[1]-1`) because node indices are 1-based in the input, but 0-based in the code.


* **Dijkstra's Algorithm:**
    * `q.offer(new int[]{0, k-1})`: The starting node `k` is added to the priority queue with a distance of 0.
    * `dis[k-1] = 0`: The distance to the starting node is set to 0.
    * The `while` loop continues as long as the priority queue is not empty.
    * `q.poll()`: The node with the minimum distance is removed from the priority queue.
    * The inner `for` loop iterates through the neighbors of the current node.
    * `if(tim+w < dis[v])`: If a shorter path to a neighbor `v` is found, the distance `dis[v]` is updated, and the neighbor is added to the priority queue.


* **Result Calculation:**
    * The final `for` loop checks if all nodes are reachable (`dis[v] != Integer.MAX_VALUE`). If not, it returns -1.  Otherwise, it finds the maximum distance among all nodes, which represents the maximum time to reach all nodes.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(E log V), where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices (nodes).  The dominant factor is the priority queue operations (insertion and extraction) within Dijkstra's algorithm.

* **Space Complexity:** O(V + E).  The space is mainly used by the adjacency list (`adj`), the distance array (`dis`), and the priority queue (`q`).  In the worst case, the adjacency list can store all edges, and the priority queue can contain all nodes.

The provided solution efficiently solves the Network Delay Time problem using Dijkstra's algorithm with a priority queue, achieving optimal time complexity for this type of problem.
