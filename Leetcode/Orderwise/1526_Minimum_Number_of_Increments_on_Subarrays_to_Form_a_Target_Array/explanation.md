### Problem Understanding

The problem asks for the minimum number of operations required to transform an initial array of zeros (of the same length as the `target` array) into the specified `target` array.

The allowed operation is: Choose any contiguous subarray and increment all elements within that subarray by one. We are seeking the minimum total count of these operations.

### Approach / Intuition

This problem can be solved efficiently using a **Greedy** approach based on analyzing the differences between adjacent elements in the target array.

#### The Skyline Analogy

Imagine the `target` array as a skyline or a set of buildings. Each operation corresponds to placing a block of height 1 across a certain range of indices. To minimize the total number of operations, we want to maximize the utility of each operation, meaning we want operations to cover as wide a range as possible.

#### Core Greedy Logic (Difference Analysis)

Consider how we build the array from left to right:

1.  **Base Case ($T[0]$):** To achieve the height $T[0]$ at the first index, we must perform exactly $T[0]$ operations that cover index 0. Since the array starts at 0, this is our initial cost.

2.  **Subsequent Elements ($T[i]$ vs. $T[i-1]$):**
    *   **Case 1: $T[i] > T[i-1]$ (Increase in height)**
        If the current element $T[i]$ is higher than the previous element $T[i-1]$, the operations that built $T[i-1]$ already provide a height of $T[i-1]$ at index $i$. We only need to account for the *additional* height required: $T[i] - T[i-1]$. This difference must be covered by $T[i] - T[i-1]$ *new* operations that start at or before index $i$ and extend at least to index $i$. By only counting this positive difference, we ensure we are reusing the maximum possible number of previous operations.
    *   **Case 2: $T[i] \le T[i-1]$ (Decrease or Equal height)**
        If $T[i]$ is less than or equal to $T[i-1]$, the operations that built $T[i-1]$ are already sufficient to cover the required height $T[i]$. No *new* operations are needed starting at index $i$ just to reach $T[i]$. We add 0 to the total count.

By summing the initial height $T[0]$ and all subsequent positive differences, we ensure that every required increment is accounted for exactly once, leading to the minimum total number of operations.

The formula derived from this intuition is:
$$
\text{Total Operations} = T[0] + \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \max(0, T[i] - T[i-1])
$$

### Data Structures and Algorithms

1.  **Data Structure:** Array (`int[] target`).
2.  **Algorithm:** Greedy Algorithm combined with a single pass iteration (linear scan).

### Code Walkthrough

The provided Java solution implements the derived greedy formula directly.

```java
class Solution {
    public int minNumberOperations(int[] target) {
        // 1. Initialization: Base cost
        int ans = target[0]; 

        // 2. Iteration: Calculate positive differences
        for(int i = 1;i <target.length; i++) {
            // Calculate the required *new* operations needed at index i.
            // This is target[i] - target[i-1], but only if the result is positive.
            int difference = target[i] - target[i-1];
            
            // Add the difference only if it represents an increase in height.
            ans += Math.max(0, difference);
        }

        // 3. Return the total minimum operations
        return ans;
    }
}
```

1.  **`int ans = target[0];`**
    The variable `ans` is initialized to the value of the first element, `target[0]`. As established by the base case, this is the minimum number of operations required to set the height of the first index.

2.  **`for(int i = 1; i < target.length; i++)`**
    The loop iterates through the array starting from the second element (`i=1`) to compare each element with its predecessor.

3.  **`ans += Math.max(0, target[i] - target[i-1]);`**
    This is the core calculation.
    *   It calculates the difference: `target[i] - target[i-1]`.
    *   `Math.max(0, ...)` ensures that we only add the difference if it is positive (i.e., if $T[i]$ is strictly greater than $T[i-1]$). If $T[i] \le T[i-1]$, we add 0, meaning no new operations are counted at this step.
    *   This positive difference represents the minimum number of *new* operations required starting at index $i$ to achieve the target height $T[i]$, given the operations already covering $T[i-1]$.

4.  **`return ans;`**
    The final accumulated sum represents the minimum total number of operations.

### Time and Space Complexity

#### Time Complexity: $O(N)$

The solution involves a single pass (a `for` loop) over the `target` array, where $N$ is the length of the array. Since we perform a constant number of operations (subtraction, comparison, addition) inside the loop, the time complexity is linear, proportional to the size of the input.

#### Space Complexity: $O(1)$

The solution uses only a few integer variables (`ans`, `i`, `difference`) to store intermediate results, regardless of the size of the input array. Therefore, the space complexity is constant.
