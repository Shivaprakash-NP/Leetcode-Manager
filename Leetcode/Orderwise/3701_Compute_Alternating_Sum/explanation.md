## LeetCode Problem: Compute Alternating Sum - Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to calculate the alternating sum of an array of integers. The alternating sum is computed by adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. For example, if the input array is `[4, 2, 5, 3]`, the alternating sum would be `4 - 2 + 5 - 3 = 4`.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The most straightforward approach to solve this problem is to iterate through the input array and maintain two sums: one for the elements at even indices (`s1`) and another for the elements at odd indices (`s2`).  We can determine whether an index is even or odd using the modulo operator (`%`). After iterating through the entire array, we simply return the difference between `s1` and `s2` which gives us the alternating sum.

This approach is chosen due to its simplicity, directness, and efficiency. It doesn't require any complex data structures or algorithms and processes each element in the array only once.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:**  We are using a simple array (`int[] nums`) as input. No other complex data structures are used.
*   **Algorithms:** The algorithm is a simple iterative approach using a `for` loop and the modulo operator.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int alternatingSum(int[] nums) {
        int s1 = 0; // Initialize the sum of elements at even indices to 0
        int s2 = 0; // Initialize the sum of elements at odd indices to 0
        for(int i = 0; i<nums.length; i++) { // Iterate through the array
            if(i%2 == 0) s1+=nums[i]; // If the index is even, add the element to s1
            else s2+=nums[i]; // If the index is odd, add the element to s2
        }
        return s1-s2; // Return the difference between s1 and s2, which is the alternating sum
    }
}
```

*   **`class Solution { ... }`**: This defines a class named `Solution` which is common in LeetCode problems.
*   **`public int alternatingSum(int[] nums) { ... }`**: This defines a public method named `alternatingSum` that takes an integer array `nums` as input and returns an integer representing the alternating sum.
*   **`int s1 = 0;`**: Initializes an integer variable `s1` to 0. This variable will store the sum of elements at even indices.
*   **`int s2 = 0;`**: Initializes an integer variable `s2` to 0. This variable will store the sum of elements at odd indices.
*   **`for(int i = 0; i<nums.length; i++) { ... }`**: This `for` loop iterates through each element of the input array `nums`. `i` represents the index of the current element.
*   **`if(i%2 == 0) s1+=nums[i];`**: Inside the loop, this `if` statement checks if the current index `i` is even. If `i` is even (i.e., `i % 2` is 0), the element at that index (`nums[i]`) is added to `s1`.
*   **`else s2+=nums[i];`**: If the `if` condition is false (i.e., `i` is odd), the element at that index (`nums[i]`) is added to `s2`.
*   **`return s1-s2;`**: After the loop finishes iterating through all the elements in the array, this line returns the difference between `s1` and `s2`. This difference represents the alternating sum.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** The code iterates through the input array `nums` once using a `for` loop. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the array.

*   **Space Complexity:** The code uses a constant amount of extra space to store the variables `s1`, and `s2`. The space used does not depend on the size of the input array.  Therefore, the space complexity is O(1).
