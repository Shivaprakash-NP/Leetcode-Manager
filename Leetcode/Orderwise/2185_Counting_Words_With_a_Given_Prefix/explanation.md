## Counting Words With a Given Prefix - Detailed Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to count the number of words in a given array of strings (`words`) that have a specific prefix (`pref`). In simpler terms, we need to iterate through the `words` array and check for each word if it *starts with* the `pref` string. The final count of such words should be returned.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The approach is straightforward and based on direct string comparison. For each word in the input array `words`, we check if the word's length is at least as long as the prefix.  If it is, we extract the first `n` characters of the word (where `n` is the length of the prefix) and compare it to the prefix string.  If these two strings are equal, we increment the count.

This approach is chosen because it's the most intuitive and efficient way to solve the problem.  String comparison is a fundamental operation, and substring extraction is readily available in most programming languages. There's no need for complex data structures or algorithms.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:** The primary data structure used is the `String` array `words`.  We also use `String` variables `pref` and `v2` to store the prefix and the extracted substring, respectively.
*   **Algorithms:** The core algorithm is a simple linear iteration through the `words` array. Within the loop, we use string comparison and substring extraction, which are considered basic string manipulation operations.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int prefixCount(String[] words, String pref) {
        int c = 0; // Initialize a counter to store the number of words with the given prefix.
        int s = pref.length(); // Store the length of the prefix for efficiency (avoid repeated calls to pref.length()).

        for(String v : words) // Iterate through each string 'v' in the 'words' array.
        {
            if(v.length()>=s) // Check if the current word 'v' is at least as long as the prefix.  If it isn't, it cannot possibly start with the prefix.
            {
                String v2 = v.substring(0, s); // Extract the first 's' characters from the word 'v' to create a substring 'v2'. This substring represents the potential prefix of 'v'.  v.substring(0, s) will extract substring from index 0 up to (but not including) index s.
                if(pref.equals(v2)) // Compare the extracted substring 'v2' with the given prefix 'pref'. The 'equals' method performs a content-based comparison of the two strings.
                    c++; // If the extracted substring and the prefix are equal, increment the counter 'c'.
            }
        }
        return c; // Return the final count of words that have the given prefix.
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Initialization:**  `int c = 0;` initializes a counter `c` to 0. This counter will track the number of words that start with the given prefix. `int s = pref.length();` calculates and stores the length of the prefix. This is done to avoid repeatedly calling `pref.length()` inside the loop, which slightly improves efficiency.

2.  **Iteration:** `for(String v : words)` starts a loop that iterates through each word `v` in the input array `words`.  This is an enhanced for loop (also known as a for-each loop).

3.  **Length Check:** `if(v.length()>=s)` checks if the length of the current word `v` is greater than or equal to the length of the prefix `s`. If the word is shorter than the prefix, it cannot possibly start with the prefix, so we skip to the next word.

4.  **Substring Extraction:** `String v2 = v.substring(0, s);` extracts the first `s` characters (i.e., the number of characters equal to the length of the prefix) from the current word `v` and stores them in a new string `v2`.  This substring is the part of the word that *might* be equal to the prefix.  Note: `substring(0, s)` extracts characters from index 0 up to (but not including) index `s`.

5.  **Prefix Comparison:** `if(pref.equals(v2))` compares the extracted substring `v2` with the input prefix `pref`.  The `equals()` method is used for comparing strings in Java to ensure we are comparing the contents of the strings, not just their references.

6.  **Increment Counter:** `c++;` increments the counter `c` if the extracted substring `v2` is equal to the input prefix `pref`.  This means that the current word `v` starts with the given prefix.

7.  **Return Result:** `return c;` returns the final value of the counter `c`, which represents the total number of words in the input array `words` that start with the given prefix `pref`.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is O(N * M), where N is the number of words in the `words` array and M is the length of the prefix `pref`.  We iterate through each word in the `words` array (O(N)). Inside the loop, we extract a substring (O(M)) and compare it with the prefix (O(M) in the worst case). Hence, the total time complexity is O(N * M).

*   **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(M), where M is the length of the prefix. This is because we create a new string `v2` of length `M` using the `substring()` method in each iteration of the loop. In the worst-case scenario, if all strings in the input `words` have a prefix `pref`, we will have created `N` substrings each of length `M`, but they are garbage collected within each loop so we only need space for one substring of length `M` at a given time. The space used for the counter `c` and the integer `s` is considered constant and does not significantly affect the overall space complexity.
