## Smallest Missing Multiple of K

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to find the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of `k` but is *not* present in the input array `nums`.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The approach is straightforward:

1.  **Store the numbers:** Create a HashSet to efficiently check for the existence of a number in the `nums` array.
2.  **Iterate through multiples of k:** Start checking multiples of `k` (i.e., `k`, `2k`, `3k`, ...) one by one.
3.  **Check for presence:** For each multiple, check if it exists in the HashSet. If a multiple `i*k` is *not* in the set, it means we've found the smallest missing multiple of `k`, so we return it.

The intuition is based on the fact that we need the *smallest* missing multiple of `k`. Therefore, we can start from the smallest possible multiple (`k`) and check progressively larger multiples until we encounter one that is not in `nums`. Using a HashSet allows us to perform the "contains" check in near-constant time, which makes the overall solution efficient.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **HashSet:** Used to store the numbers from the input array `nums` for efficient membership checks (checking if a number is present in `nums`). This provides O(1) average-case time complexity for `contains()` operation.
*   **Iteration:** A simple `for` loop to iterate through the multiples of `k`.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int missingMultiple(int[] nums, int k) {
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();

        // Store all the numbers from nums into a HashSet.
        for(int v : nums) set.add(v);

        // Start iterating from i=1 and check for multiples of k (i*k).
        for(int i = 1; ; i++) {
            // If the current multiple of k (i*k) is not present in the set...
            if(!set.contains(i*k)) return i*k; // ...we have found the smallest missing multiple, so return it.
        }
    }
}
```

*   **`Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();`**:  Creates an empty HashSet to store the integers from the input array `nums`.
*   **`for(int v : nums) set.add(v);`**:  Iterates through the `nums` array and adds each element `v` into the `set`. This step creates a quick lookup table of the input array's contents.
*   **`for(int i = 1; ; i++) { ... }`**: This is an infinite loop that starts with `i = 1`. Inside the loop, we are checking multiples of `k`: `1*k`, `2*k`, `3*k`, and so on.
*   **`if(!set.contains(i*k)) return i*k;`**: This is the core logic.
    *   `i*k` calculates the current multiple of `k`.
    *   `set.contains(i*k)` checks if this multiple already exists in the input numbers (stored in the `set`).
    *   `!set.contains(i*k)` negates the result. So, the `if` condition is true *only if* the multiple `i*k` is *not* present in the input numbers.
    *   If the multiple is not present, `return i*k;` immediately returns that multiple as the smallest missing multiple of `k`.  Because the loop starts from `i=1`, we are guaranteed to find the *smallest* such multiple.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(N + M), where N is the length of the input array `nums` and M is the value of the smallest missing multiple of k divided by k.
    *   O(N) for adding elements into the HashSet.
    *   O(M) for the `for` loop, where `M` is the number of iterations needed to find the smallest missing multiple. In the worst-case scenario, `M` could be relatively large if the input array contains many multiples of `k`. Since `M` depends on the input data, we could consider it in relation to the output as the number of iterations is proportional to the found value (i*k).
*   **Space Complexity:** O(N), where N is the length of the input array `nums`. This is due to storing the numbers from `nums` in the HashSet.
