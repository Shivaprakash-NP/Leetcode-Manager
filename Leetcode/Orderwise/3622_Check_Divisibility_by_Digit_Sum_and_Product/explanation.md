## LeetCode: Check Divisibility by Digit Sum and Product - Solution Explained

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to determine if a given integer `n` is divisible by the sum of its digits plus the product of its digits.  In simpler terms, we need to check if `n` is divisible by `(sum of digits) + (product of digits)`.


**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution uses a straightforward approach.  It iteratively extracts each digit from the input number `n`, calculates the sum and product of these digits, and then checks if `n` is divisible by the sum of these two values. This approach is efficient because it directly addresses the problem's requirements without resorting to more complex algorithms or data structures.  There are no significant optimizations needed because the input size (number of digits) is relatively small for typical LeetCode constraints.

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**  The solution uses only primitive integer variables (`n`, `tem`, `sum`, `pro`, `d`). No sophisticated data structures are needed.
* **Algorithms:** The core algorithm is a simple iterative process (the `while` loop) to extract digits.  The algorithm's complexity is linear with the number of digits in the input.


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean checkDivisibility(int n) {
        int tem = n; // Create a temporary copy of n to avoid modifying the original
        int sum = 0; // Initialize the sum of digits
        int pro = 1; // Initialize the product of digits (starting with 1 to handle multiplication)
        while(tem!=0) { // Iterate through each digit
            int d = tem%10; // Extract the last digit using the modulo operator
            sum+=d; // Add the digit to the sum
            pro*=d; // Multiply the digit into the product
            tem/=10; // Remove the last digit by integer division
        }
        sum+=pro; // Add the product to the sum
        return (n%sum == 0); // Check if n is divisible by the final sum and return the result
    }
}
```

* **Lines 2-4:** Initialization. `tem` is a copy of `n` to preserve the original. `sum` and `pro` are initialized to 0 and 1 respectively.  `pro` starts at 1 because multiplying by 0 would always result in 0.

* **Line 5-8:** The `while` loop iterates as long as `tem` is not 0. Inside the loop:
    * `d = tem % 10;` extracts the last digit of `tem`.
    * `sum += d;` adds the extracted digit to `sum`.
    * `pro *= d;` multiplies the extracted digit with `pro`.
    * `tem /= 10;` removes the last digit from `tem`.

* **Line 9:** The sum of digits and the product of digits are combined.

* **Line 10:** The modulo operator (`%`) checks for divisibility.  The function returns `true` if `n` is divisible by `sum`, otherwise `false`.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(log₁₀(n)). The loop iterates once for each digit in the input number `n`. The number of digits is proportional to the logarithm base 10 of `n`.  Therefore, the time complexity is logarithmic with respect to the input number.

* **Space Complexity:** O(1). The solution uses only a constant number of integer variables regardless of the input size.  The space used is constant.
