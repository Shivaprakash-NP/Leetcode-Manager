## Search a 2D Matrix Problem Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to determine if a given `target` integer exists within a 2D integer matrix. This matrix has a specific property:

*   Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order (from left to right).
*   The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

In essence, the entire matrix is sorted as if it were a single, large sorted array wrapped into a rectangular grid.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is to leverage the sorted nature of the matrix to efficiently search for the `target` value. We'll use a two-step binary search approach:

1.  **Find the Row:** First, we perform a binary search on the *first element of each row* to identify a row that potentially contains the `target`. This is because if the `target` falls within the range of the first and last elements of a row, it could potentially be present in that row.  The condition  `matrix[m][0]<=target && matrix[m][matrix[0].length-1]>=target` checks whether the target lies within the range of elements in the `mth` row.

2.  **Search Within the Row:** Once we've identified the potential row, we perform another binary search within that row to determine if the `target` actually exists.

This approach is efficient because binary search significantly reduces the search space in each step. By first narrowing down the search to a single row, and then searching only within that row, we avoid iterating through the entire matrix.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structure:** 2D Integer Array ( `int[][] matrix` )
*   **Algorithm:** Binary Search

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean searchMatrix(int[][] matrix, int target) {
        int l = 0;
        int r = matrix.length-1;
        int ind = -1; // Index of the row that might contain the target

        // First Binary Search: Find the row
        while(l<=r)
        {
            int m = (l+r)/2; // Calculate the middle row index

            // Check if the target could be in this row
            if(matrix[m][0]<=target && matrix[m][matrix[0].length-1]>=target)
            {
                ind = m; // Store the row index
                break; // Exit the loop because we found a potential row
            }

            // If the first element of the row is less than or equal to the target,
            // it means the target might be in a row below (or is in this row).
            // We move the left pointer to explore rows below.
            if(matrix[m][0]<=target) l = m+1;

            // Otherwise, the target must be in a row above (if it exists at all).
            // We move the right pointer to explore rows above.
            else r = m-1;
        }

        l = 0;
        r = matrix[0].length-1;

        // If no suitable row was found in the first search, the target is not in the matrix.
        if(ind == -1) return false;

        // Second Binary Search: Search within the identified row
        while(l<=r)
        {
            int m = (l+r)/2; // Calculate the middle column index

            // If the target is found, return true
            if(matrix[ind][m]==target) return true;

            // If the current element is less than the target, search to the right.
            if(matrix[ind][m]<target) l = m+1;

            // Otherwise, search to the left.
            else r = m-1;
        }

        // If the target was not found in the identified row, return false.
        return false;
    }
}
```

**Explanation of Code Sections:**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   `l = 0;`: Initializes the left pointer for the first binary search (row search).
    *   `r = matrix.length - 1;`: Initializes the right pointer for the first binary search (row search).
    *   `ind = -1;`: Initializes `ind` to -1. This variable will store the index of the row that potentially contains the target. If it remains -1 after the first binary search, it means no suitable row was found.

2.  **First Binary Search (Finding the Row):**
    *   `while (l <= r)`: Standard binary search loop condition.
    *   `int m = (l + r) / 2;`: Calculates the middle row index.
    *   `if (matrix[m][0] <= target && matrix[m][matrix[0].length - 1] >= target)`:  This is the crucial condition. It checks if the `target` falls within the range of values in the `m`-th row.  `matrix[m][0]` is the first element of the row, and `matrix[m][matrix[0].length - 1]` is the last element.  If the target is between these two values (inclusive), it's possible that the target exists in this row.
    *   `ind = m; break;`: If the target might be in this row, we store the row index in `ind` and exit the first binary search loop.
    *   `if (matrix[m][0] <= target) l = m + 1;`: If the first element of the current row is less than or equal to the target, it means the target could potentially be in a row *below* the current row. We update `l` to search the rows below. Note that in the case that the target is actually in the current row, and the current row is chosen by this `if` statement, then the row has been correctly marked by the previous `if` statement and the loop will terminate.
    *   `else r = m - 1;`: Otherwise, the first element of the current row is greater than the target, indicating that the target must be in a row *above* the current row (if it exists).  We update `r` to search the rows above.

3.  **Second Binary Search (Searching Within the Row):**
    *   `if (ind == -1) return false;`: Checks if the first binary search found a suitable row. If `ind` is still -1, it means the target is not in the matrix.
    *   `l = 0; r = matrix[0].length - 1;`: Initializes the left and right pointers for the second binary search (column search within the selected row).
    *   `while (l <= r)`: Standard binary search loop condition.
    *   `int m = (l + r) / 2;`: Calculates the middle column index.
    *   `if (matrix[ind][m] == target) return true;`: If the element at the current row and column is equal to the target, we found the target and return `true`.
    *   `if (matrix[ind][m] < target) l = m + 1;`: If the element is less than the target, we search to the right.
    *   `else r = m - 1;`: If the element is greater than the target, we search to the left.

4.  **Return False:** If the second binary search completes without finding the target, it means the target is not in the identified row, so we return `false`.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(log m + log n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. The first binary search (row search) takes O(log m) time, and the second binary search (column search) takes O(log n) time.

*   **Space Complexity:** O(1). The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the size of the matrix. We are only using a few integer variables to store indices and temporary values. The binary searches are performed in-place, without needing any additional data structures that scale with the input size.
