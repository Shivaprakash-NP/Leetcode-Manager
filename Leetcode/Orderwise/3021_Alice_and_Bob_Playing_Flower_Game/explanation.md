## LeetCode Problem: Alice and Bob Playing Flower Game (Explained)

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem, while not explicitly stated, implicitly describes a scenario where Alice and Bob are playing a game involving `n` even-numbered flower pots and `m` odd-numbered flower pots. Alice gets to pick flowers from even-numbered pots and Bob from odd-numbered pots.  The problem asks to calculate the total number of ways Alice and Bob can pick one flower pot each (one even and one odd).  The code calculates the total number of possible pairs by multiplying the number of even pots Alice can choose from by the number of odd pots Bob can choose from, and vice versa, and then summing these products.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution employs a simple combinatorial approach.  It directly calculates the number of ways Alice and Bob can choose their pots independently.  We calculate the number of even and odd numbered flower pots.  Then the total number of ways they can choose is the product of the number of even pots available to Alice and the number of odd pots available to Bob, plus the product of the number of odd pots available to Alice and the number of even pots available to Bob. This approach is chosen due to its efficiency and directness; it avoids unnecessary iterations or complex data structures.

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

The solution uses only basic arithmetic operations. No sophisticated data structures or algorithms are required.  It leverages simple integer variables to store the counts of even and odd-numbered pots.

**4. Code Walkthrough:**

```java
class Solution {
    public long flowerGame(int n, int m) {
        long even_n = n/2;        // Calculates the number of even-numbered pots from n
        long even_m = m/2;        // Calculates the number of even-numbered pots from m
        long odd_n = n-even_n;    // Calculates the number of odd-numbered pots from n
        long odd_m = m-even_m;    // Calculates the number of odd-numbered pots from m

        return (even_n*odd_m)+(even_m*odd_n); // Returns the total number of ways Alice and Bob can pick
    }
}
```

* **`long even_n = n/2;` and `long even_m = m/2;`:** These lines calculate the number of even-numbered pots in `n` and `m` respectively using integer division.  The use of `long` is important to avoid potential integer overflow if `n` and `m` are very large.

* **`long odd_n = n-even_n;` and `long odd_m = m-even_m;`:** These lines calculate the number of odd-numbered pots by subtracting the number of even pots from the total number of pots.

* **`return (even_n*odd_m)+(even_m*odd_n);`:** This line calculates the total number of combinations. It's the sum of two products: (even pots in `n` * odd pots in `m`) + (even pots in `m` * odd pots in `n`).  This represents all possible pairings of one even and one odd pot.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(1). The solution performs a fixed number of arithmetic operations regardless of the input size.

* **Space Complexity:** O(1). The solution uses a constant amount of extra space to store the variables `even_n`, `even_m`, `odd_n`, and `odd_m`.  The space used is independent of the input size.


**In summary:** This solution efficiently solves the problem using a straightforward mathematical approach.  Its simplicity and constant time complexity make it highly optimized.  The use of `long` demonstrates good coding practice by anticipating potential integer overflow issues.
