## LeetCode Problem: Rotate String - Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The "Rotate String" problem asks whether string `goal` can be obtained by rotating string `s` a certain number of times.  A rotation operation involves moving the leftmost character of `s` to the rightmost position.  For example, if `s` is "abcde", one rotation gives "bcdea". We need to determine if, through repeated rotations of `s`, we can eventually obtain `goal`.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The key insight here is that if `goal` is a rotation of `s`, then `goal` must be a substring of `s` concatenated with itself (i.e., `s + s`).  For example, if `s` is "abcde" and `goal` is "cdeab", then `s + s` is "abcdeabcde", and "cdeab" is indeed a substring of it.

Why does this work?  Because every possible rotation of `s` is present as a substring in `s + s`.  Imagine all rotations of "abcde":

*   "abcde"
*   "bcdea"
*   "cdeab"
*   "deabc"
*   "eabcd"

All of these are present within "abcdeabcde".

Therefore, the approach is:

1.  Check if `s` and `goal` have the same length. If they don't, `goal` cannot be a rotation of `s`, and we return `false`.
2.  Concatenate `s` with itself (`s = s + s`).
3.  Check if `goal` is a substring of the concatenated string `s`. If it is, `goal` is a rotation of `s`, and we return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

This approach is chosen because it's a relatively simple and efficient way to determine if one string is a rotation of another without performing explicit rotation operations.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:** The primary data structure used is `String`.
*   **Algorithms:** The `contains()` method, internally utilizes string searching algorithms (likely a variation of Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) or Boyer-Moore algorithm for efficient substring searching, but the exact implementation is hidden by the Java String API).

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean rotateString(String s, String goal) {
        if(s.length()==goal.length())
        {
            s = s+s;
            if(s.contains(goal)) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

1.  **`class Solution { ... }`:** Defines the `Solution` class, which is a standard convention for LeetCode submissions.

2.  **`public boolean rotateString(String s, String goal) { ... }`:** Defines the `rotateString` method. It takes two strings, `s` and `goal`, as input and returns a boolean indicating whether `goal` is a rotation of `s`.

3.  **`if(s.length()==goal.length()) { ... }`:** This is the first check.  If the lengths of `s` and `goal` are different, `goal` cannot be a rotation of `s`, so we skip the rest of the logic and return `false` at the end.

4.  **`s = s+s;`:**  This line concatenates `s` with itself. This is the core part of the algorithm. As explained in the "Approach" section, this creates a string where all possible rotations of the original `s` are present as substrings.

5.  **`if(s.contains(goal)) return true;`:** This line uses the `contains()` method of the `String` class to check if `goal` is a substring of the concatenated string `s`.  If it is, it means `goal` is a rotation of the original `s`, and the method returns `true`.

6.  **`return false;`:** If the initial length check fails or if `goal` is not found as a substring of the concatenated `s`, this line returns `false`, indicating that `goal` is not a rotation of `s`.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** The dominant operation is `s.contains(goal)`. The `contains()` method in Java `String` class typically has a time complexity of O(n*m) in the worst case, where `n` is the length of `s + s` (which is 2 * length of original `s`) and `m` is the length of `goal`. However, efficient implementations like KMP or Boyer-Moore can achieve O(n+m) in many cases. The concatenation `s = s + s` takes O(n) time.  The length comparison is O(1). Therefore, the overall time complexity is generally considered to be **O(n*m)**, but can be better (O(n+m)) if an efficient string search algorithm is used within `contains()`, where `n` is the length of `s` and `m` is the length of `goal`.

*   **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is primarily determined by the concatenated string `s = s + s`.  The length of this new `s` is twice the length of the original `s`. Therefore, the space complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the original string `s`.
