## Majority Element Problem Explanation

This document provides a detailed explanation of the Java code solution for the LeetCode problem "Majority Element".

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The "Majority Element" problem asks us to find the element in an array that appears more than `n / 2` times, where `n` is the size of the array.  We are guaranteed that a majority element always exists within the input array.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The solution uses **Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm**. The core idea behind this algorithm is that if a majority element exists (i.e., occurs more than n/2 times), we can iteratively maintain a candidate and a counter. When we encounter the candidate, we increment the counter. When we encounter a different element, we decrement the counter. If the counter becomes zero, it means the previous candidate is no longer a potential majority element, and we update the candidate to the current element and reset the counter to 1.

Why does this work?  Since the majority element appears more than n/2 times, even if we encounter other elements that decrement the counter, the majority element's frequency will eventually outweigh the others, and it will remain as the final candidate.  The beauty of this approach is that it avoids the need for extra space, providing an efficient solution.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:** The solution uses only primitive data types like `int`. No explicit data structures like hash maps or sets are employed.
*   **Algorithms:** The core algorithm is the **Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm**.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int majorityElement(int[] nums) {
        int value = nums[0]; // Initialize the candidate majority element with the first element of the array.
        int c = 1; // Initialize the counter to 1, indicating that the current candidate has been seen once.

        for(int i = 1 ; i<nums.length ; i++) // Iterate through the array starting from the second element.
        {
            if(nums[i]==value) // If the current element is the same as the candidate...
                c++; // ...increment the counter.
            else // If the current element is different from the candidate...
                c--; // ...decrement the counter.

            if(c==0) // If the counter becomes zero...
            {
                value = nums[i]; // ...update the candidate to the current element.
                c++; // ...reset the counter to 1.
            }
        }
        return value; // After iterating through the entire array, the 'value' variable will hold the majority element.
    }
}
```

**Explanation Breakdown:**

1.  **Initialization:** `value` is initialized with the first element of the array (`nums[0]`), and `c` (the counter) is initialized to 1.

2.  **Iteration:** The `for` loop iterates through the array from the second element (`i = 1`) to the end.

3.  **Comparison and Counter Update:**
    *   `if (nums[i] == value)`: If the current element `nums[i]` is equal to the current candidate `value`, the counter `c` is incremented. This indicates that we've encountered another occurrence of the potential majority element.
    *   `else`: If the current element `nums[i]` is different from the current candidate `value`, the counter `c` is decremented. This means we've encountered an element that cancels out one occurrence of the current candidate.

4.  **Candidate Update:**
    *   `if (c == 0)`: If the counter `c` becomes 0, it means that the current candidate `value` has been "cancelled out" by other elements. Therefore, we update the candidate `value` to the current element `nums[i]` and reset the counter `c` to 1.  This signifies that we are starting a new potential majority element candidate.

5.  **Return Value:** After the loop completes, the `value` variable will hold the majority element. This is because the majority element appears more than n/2 times, ensuring that it will eventually become and remain the candidate.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity: O(n)** - The code iterates through the array once, making the time complexity linear with respect to the size of the input array.

*   **Space Complexity: O(1)** - The code uses only a constant amount of extra space (for the `value` and `c` variables), regardless of the size of the input array. This makes the space complexity constant.

In summary, the solution is an efficient and elegant approach to finding the majority element in an array, utilizing the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm to achieve linear time complexity and constant space complexity.
