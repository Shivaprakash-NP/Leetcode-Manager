## Asteroid Collision Problem Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem describes a scenario where asteroids are moving in a single line. Each asteroid is represented by an integer, where the absolute value denotes its size and the sign denotes its direction (positive for right, negative for left). If two asteroids collide, the smaller one explodes. If they are the same size, both explode. The goal is to determine the state of the asteroids after all collisions have occurred, represented as an array of the remaining asteroids.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The key idea is to use a stack to simulate the collisions. We iterate through the asteroids array.  If we encounter an asteroid moving to the right (positive), we simply push it onto the stack, as it can only collide with asteroids coming from the right (negative). If we encounter an asteroid moving to the left (negative), we check if there are any asteroids moving to the right on the stack. If so, a collision occurs.

The collisions are handled in a `while` loop. This loop continues as long as:

1.  The current asteroid `v` is moving to the left (`v < 0`).
2.  The stack is not empty.
3.  The top element of the stack is moving to the right (`stack.peekLast() > 0`).
4.  The current asteroid `v` is still alive (`alive` is true).

Inside the loop, we compare the sizes of the colliding asteroids.  There are three possibilities:

*   If the asteroid on the stack is smaller than the current negative asteroid, the asteroid on the stack explodes (we pop it from the stack).
*   If the asteroid on the stack is the same size as the current negative asteroid, both explode (we pop the asteroid from the stack, and set `alive` to `false` to mark the current asteroid as destroyed.)
*   If the asteroid on the stack is larger than the current negative asteroid, the current negative asteroid explodes (we set `alive` to `false`, and the loop breaks because the negative asteroid is no longer alive).

If, after the `while` loop, the current asteroid is still "alive" (meaning it hasn't been destroyed in any collisions), we push it onto the stack.

Finally, we convert the stack to an array and return it.

This approach works because the stack effectively tracks the asteroids that are moving to the right and are susceptible to collisions from the left. By resolving collisions on the fly, we accurately determine the remaining asteroids.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Stack (Deque):** Used to store asteroids moving to the right. The stack allows for efficient retrieval of the most recently added asteroid, which is crucial for collision detection.
*   **Iteration:** Iterating through the input array of asteroids.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] asteroidCollision(int[] asteroids) {
        Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>(); // Initialize a stack to store asteroids
        for (int v : asteroids) { // Iterate through the asteroids array
            boolean alive = true; // Flag to indicate if the current asteroid is still alive
            while (alive && v < 0 && !stack.isEmpty() && stack.peekLast() > 0) { // Collision loop
                if (stack.peekLast() < -v) stack.pollLast(); // Stack asteroid explodes
                else if (stack.peekLast() == -v) { // Both asteroids explode
                    stack.pollLast();
                    alive = false;
                } else { // Current asteroid explodes
                    alive = false;
                }
            }
            if (alive) stack.addLast(v); // Add the asteroid to the stack if it's still alive
        }

        int[] ans = new int[stack.size()]; // Create an array to store the result
        int i = 0;
        for (int val : stack) ans[i++] = val; // Copy the stack elements to the array
        return ans; // Return the result array
    }
}
```

*   **`Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();`**: Initializes a double-ended queue (`Deque`) implemented as an `ArrayDeque`, which we'll use as a stack.
*   **`for (int v : asteroids)`**:  Iterates through each asteroid `v` in the `asteroids` array.
*   **`boolean alive = true;`**: Initializes a boolean variable `alive` to `true`.  This variable tracks whether the current asteroid `v` has been destroyed in a collision.
*   **`while (alive && v < 0 && !stack.isEmpty() && stack.peekLast() > 0)`**: This `while` loop handles the collision logic. It continues as long as:
    *   `alive`: The current asteroid is still "alive".
    *   `v < 0`: The current asteroid is moving to the left (negative direction).
    *   `!stack.isEmpty()`: The stack is not empty (there are asteroids moving right).
    *   `stack.peekLast() > 0`: The top asteroid on the stack is moving to the right (positive direction).
*   **`if (stack.peekLast() < -v) stack.pollLast();`**:  If the absolute value of the current asteroid `v` is greater than the asteroid on the stack, the asteroid on the stack explodes. We remove it from the stack using `stack.pollLast()`.
*   **`else if (stack.peekLast() == -v) { stack.pollLast(); alive = false; }`**: If the absolute value of the current asteroid `v` is equal to the asteroid on the stack, both explode. We remove the asteroid from the stack using `stack.pollLast()` and set `alive` to `false`, indicating that the current asteroid `v` is destroyed.
*   **`else { alive = false; }`**: If the absolute value of the current asteroid `v` is less than the asteroid on the stack, the current asteroid explodes. We set `alive` to `false` and the loop terminates.
*   **`if (alive) stack.addLast(v);`**: If the asteroid is still "alive" after the `while` loop (meaning it didn't collide with any right-moving asteroids on the stack), we push it onto the stack.
*   **`int[] ans = new int[stack.size()];`**: Creates a new integer array `ans` with the size of the stack to store the remaining asteroids.
*   **`int i = 0; for (int val : stack) ans[i++] = val;`**: Iterates through the stack and copies the elements to the `ans` array.
*   **`return ans;`**: Returns the `ans` array containing the remaining asteroids after all collisions.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of asteroids. In the worst-case scenario, each asteroid might be pushed onto the stack and potentially popped later.  The `while` loop inside the `for` loop might iterate multiple times for a given asteroid, but the total number of pops from the stack is bounded by n, making the overall time complexity O(n).
*   **Space Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of asteroids. In the worst-case scenario, all asteroids might be moving in the same direction (e.g., all positive), and they will all be pushed onto the stack. Thus the space used by the stack can grow up to n.
