## LeetCode Problem: Bitwise ORs of Subarrays - Detailed Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to find the number of distinct bitwise OR results that can be obtained from all possible subarrays of a given integer array `arr`.  In other words, we need to iterate through all subarrays, calculate the bitwise OR of the elements within each subarray, and then count the number of unique OR results.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The key idea is to iteratively build up the set of possible OR results as we move through the array.  Instead of generating all subarrays explicitly (which would lead to a time complexity of O(n^2) for generating the subarrays and potentially O(n) for the OR operation), we maintain a `curSet` representing the set of OR values achievable from subarrays ending at the *previous* element.

For each new element `x` in the array, we can form new subarrays ending at `x`. The OR values for these new subarrays can be obtained in two ways:

1.  The subarray consisting of only `x` itself.
2.  Extending the subarrays ending at the previous element by taking the bitwise OR of `x` with each value in the `curSet`.

By updating `curSet` in each iteration, we effectively keep track of all possible OR values for subarrays ending at the current element. We also maintain `ansSet` to store all distinct OR values seen so far. The final answer is the size of `ansSet`.

**Why this approach?** This dynamic programming-esque approach avoids explicitly generating all possible subarrays. Instead, it builds the set of possible OR values incrementally, leveraging the results from the previous iteration. The time complexity is improved compared to a naive approach. The use of sets ensures we only count unique OR values.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Sets (HashSet):** `ansSet` and `curSet` are HashSets used to store unique integer values. HashSets provide O(1) average time complexity for add and contains operations, which are crucial for efficient tracking of unique OR results.
*   **Bitwise OR Operator (|):**  The core operation for calculating the bitwise OR of elements within a subarray.
*   **Iteration:** The code uses a `for-each` loop to iterate through the array `arr`.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int subarrayBitwiseORs(int[] arr) {
        Set<Integer> ansSet = new HashSet<>();
        Set<Integer> curSet = new HashSet<>();

        for(int x : arr) {
            Set<Integer> tem = new HashSet<>();
            tem.add(x);
            for(int y : curSet) tem.add(x | y);
            ansSet.addAll(tem);
            curSet = tem;
        }

        return ansSet.size();
    }
}
```

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   `ansSet = new HashSet<>();`: Initializes an empty HashSet to store the distinct bitwise OR values of all subarrays encountered so far.
    *   `curSet = new HashSet<>();`: Initializes an empty HashSet to store the distinct bitwise OR values of subarrays ending at the previous element.

2.  **Iteration:**
    *   `for(int x : arr)`:  Iterates through each element `x` in the input array `arr`.

3.  **Inner Logic:**
    *   `Set<Integer> tem = new HashSet<>();`:  Creates a new temporary HashSet `tem` for each element `x`. This set will store the OR values of subarrays ending at the current element `x`.
    *   `tem.add(x);`: Adds the current element `x` itself to `tem`. This represents the subarray containing only the element `x`.
    *   `for(int y : curSet) tem.add(x | y);`:  Iterates through the OR values in `curSet` (OR values of subarrays ending at the previous element). For each value `y` in `curSet`, it calculates the bitwise OR of `x` and `y` (`x | y`) and adds the result to `tem`. This step extends the subarrays ending at the previous element by including `x`.
    *   `ansSet.addAll(tem);`: Adds all the elements from `tem` (OR values of subarrays ending at the current element `x`) to the `ansSet`, ensuring that `ansSet` contains all distinct OR values encountered so far.
    *   `curSet = tem;`: Updates `curSet` to be equal to `tem`. This ensures that `curSet` now holds the OR values of subarrays ending at the *current* element `x`, which will be used in the next iteration.

4.  **Return Value:**
    *   `return ansSet.size();`: After iterating through all the elements in the array, the function returns the size of `ansSet`, which represents the number of distinct bitwise OR values obtained from all subarrays of the input array.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(N * K), where N is the length of the input array `arr`, and K is the maximum number of distinct bitwise OR values achievable from subarrays ending at a single element. In the worst case, the number of distinct values can be up to 32 (since the maximum possible value of an integer is 2^31 - 1). Each element contributes O(K) operations because of the inner loop that iterates over the `curSet`. Hence, the complexity is O(N * K). The average time complexity of HashSet `add` and `contains` operations is O(1). Since K is bounded by 32, we can approximate it as O(N).

*   **Space Complexity:** O(K), where K is the maximum number of distinct bitwise OR values achievable from subarrays ending at a single element. The space is used by `ansSet` and `curSet`.  In the worst-case scenario, `curSet` can contain all possible OR values formed from the current element `x` and the OR values from the previous subarray, and the number of distinct OR values is bounded by 32, as mentioned earlier.  The `ansSet` can potentially hold up to `n*32` distinct values (where n is the length of the input array). So, the space complexity is more precisely described as O(min(n*32, 2^32)), but considering `n` is often much smaller than `2^32`, we can simplify and bound this by O(32*n) in the worst case, which can be simplified as O(n). However, due to the nature of bitwise OR operations, the maximum number of unique values that `curSet` holds will never be more than 32. Since `curSet` is the bottleneck here, the space complexity is best approximated as O(32) or O(1).

In summary:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(N) (because the number of distinct values is bounded).
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1) (because the maximum number of unique values that curSet holds is always limited to 32, which is constant).
