## LeetCode: Max Number of K-Sum Pairs - Solution Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the maximum number of pairs in an integer array `nums` that sum up to a given integer `k`.  Each number in the array can only be used once in a pair.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The most efficient approach here is to use a two-pointer technique after sorting the array.  Sorting allows us to efficiently check for pairs that sum to `k`.  By using two pointers, one at the beginning (`l`) and one at the end (`r`) of the sorted array, we can systematically check all possible pairs without redundant computations. If the sum of the numbers at the pointers equals `k`, we've found a pair, increment our `ans` counter, and move both pointers. If the sum is less than `k`, we need a larger number, so we move the left pointer (`l`) to the right. If the sum is greater than `k`, we need a smaller number, so we move the right pointer (`r`) to the left. This process continues until the pointers cross each other (`l < r` becomes false), at which point all possible pairs have been checked. This approach avoids nested loops, leading to a more efficient solution than brute force.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:** The primary data structure used is an array (`nums`).
* **Algorithms:** The core algorithm employed is the two-pointer technique, which is a variation of the sliding window approach.  The array is also sorted using `Arrays.sort()`, which typically uses a variation of merge sort or quicksort (depending on the JVM implementation).


**4. Code Walkthrough:**

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxOperations(int[] nums, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(nums); // Sort the input array in ascending order.

        int l = 0;          // Left pointer, initialized to the beginning of the array.
        int r = nums.length-1; // Right pointer, initialized to the end of the array.
        int ans = 0;          // Counter for the number of pairs found.

        while(l<r) {         // Continue as long as the left pointer is before the right pointer.
            int s = nums[l]+nums[r]; // Calculate the sum of the numbers at the pointers.
            if(s == k) {       // If the sum equals k, we found a pair.
                ans++;          // Increment the counter.
                l++;            // Move the left pointer to the right.
                r--;            // Move the right pointer to the left.
            }
            else if(s<k) l++;   // If the sum is less than k, move the left pointer to increase the sum.
            else r--;           // If the sum is greater than k, move the right pointer to decrease the sum.
        }
        return ans;           // Return the total number of pairs found.
    }
}
```

**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(n log n), dominated by the sorting step (`Arrays.sort()`). The two-pointer traversal takes O(n) time.
* **Space Complexity:** O(1). The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.  We are modifying the array in place.  The space used by `l`, `r`, `ans` and `s` is constant and not related to the input size.


In summary, this solution leverages the efficiency of sorting and the two-pointer technique to solve the "Max Number of K-Sum Pairs" problem in an optimal manner with a time complexity of O(n log n) and a space complexity of O(1).  The approach is clear, concise, and easy to understand, making it a good example of efficient algorithm design.
