## Count Equal and Divisible Pairs in an Array - Explained

This document provides a detailed explanation of the Java code for the LeetCode problem "Count Equal and Divisible Pairs in an Array."

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to find the number of pairs `(i, j)` in a given integer array `nums` such that `i < j`, `nums[i] == nums[j]`, and `(i * j)` is divisible by a given integer `k`.  In other words, we need to count how many times two elements at different indices are equal and their indices product is divisible by `k`.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The most straightforward approach to solve this problem is to use a brute-force method. We iterate through all possible pairs of indices `(i, j)` in the array where `i < j`. For each pair, we check two conditions:

1.  If `nums[i]` is equal to `nums[j]`.
2.  If `(i * j)` is divisible by `k` (i.e., `(i * j) % k == 0`).

If both conditions are met, we increment a counter.  This approach is simple to implement and understand, although it might not be the most efficient for very large arrays.  However, given the constraints of the problem on LeetCode (typically small array sizes), a brute-force approach is perfectly acceptable and will pass all test cases.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:** The primary data structure used is an integer array `nums`. No other complex data structures are needed.

*   **Algorithms:** The core algorithm is a nested loop, which implements a brute-force approach to checking all possible pairs of indices.  We use the modulo operator (%) to check for divisibility.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int countPairs(int[] nums, int k) {
        int c = 0; // Initialize a counter to store the number of pairs that satisfy the conditions.
        int n = nums.length; // Store the length of the input array for efficiency.
        for(int i = 0 ; i<n ; i++) // Outer loop: Iterate from i = 0 to n-1.
        {
            for(int j = i+1 ; j<n ; j++) // Inner loop: Iterate from j = i+1 to n-1. This ensures i < j.
            {
                if((i*j)%k == 0 && nums[i]==nums[j]) // Check if both conditions are met: (i*j) is divisible by k and nums[i] equals nums[j].
                {
                    c++; // If both conditions are true, increment the counter.
                }
            }
        }
        return c; // Return the final count of pairs that satisfy the conditions.
    }
}
```

**Line-by-line Explanation:**

1.  `class Solution {`: Defines the Solution class, which is standard for LeetCode submissions.
2.  `public int countPairs(int[] nums, int k) {`: Defines the `countPairs` method that takes an integer array `nums` and an integer `k` as input and returns the number of pairs that satisfy the conditions.
3.  `int c = 0;`: Initializes an integer variable `c` to 0. This variable will store the count of the pairs that meet the criteria.
4.  `int n = nums.length;`: Stores the length of the input array `nums` in the variable `n`. This is done for efficiency to avoid repeatedly calling `nums.length` within the loops.
5.  `for(int i = 0 ; i<n ; i++)`: This is the outer loop, which iterates from `i = 0` to `n - 1`.  `i` represents the index of the first element in the pair.
6.  `for(int j = i+1 ; j<n ; j++)`: This is the inner loop, which iterates from `j = i + 1` to `n - 1`. `j` represents the index of the second element in the pair. Starting `j` at `i + 1` ensures that `i < j`, as required by the problem.
7.  `if((i*j)%k == 0 && nums[i]==nums[j])`: This is the core logic of the solution. It checks two conditions using the `&&` (AND) operator:
    *   `(i*j)%k == 0`: Checks if the product of the indices `i` and `j` is divisible by `k`.  The modulo operator `%` returns the remainder of the division. If the remainder is 0, it means the product is divisible by `k`.
    *   `nums[i]==nums[j]`: Checks if the elements at indices `i` and `j` in the `nums` array are equal.
8.  `c++;`: If both conditions in the `if` statement are true, it means the current pair `(i, j)` satisfies the problem's requirements. Therefore, the counter `c` is incremented.
9.  `return c;`: After the loops have finished iterating through all possible pairs, the method returns the final value of `c`, which represents the total number of pairs that satisfy the given conditions.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** The code uses nested loops to iterate through all possible pairs of indices.  The outer loop runs `n` times, and the inner loop runs approximately `n/2` times on average. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the length of the array.

*   **Space Complexity:** The code uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the size of the input array. We only use a few integer variables (`c`, `n`, `i`, `j`). Therefore, the space complexity is O(1).
