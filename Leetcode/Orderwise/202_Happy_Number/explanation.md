## Happy Number Problem Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The "Happy Number" problem asks us to determine if a given positive integer is a "happy number". A happy number is defined by the following process:

1.  Starting with the given number, replace it by the sum of the squares of its digits.
2.  Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
3.  Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Our task is to write a function that takes an integer as input and returns `true` if it's a happy number, and `false` otherwise.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is to simulate the process of repeatedly summing the squares of the digits. However, we need a way to detect if the process enters an infinite loop.  If we encounter a number that we've seen before during the process, it means we're stuck in a cycle, and the number is not happy.

Therefore, the approach involves:

1.  Calculating the sum of the squares of the digits in each iteration.
2.  Using a `HashSet` to keep track of the numbers we've already encountered.
3.  Checking if the current sum is already in the `HashSet`. If it is, we know we're in a cycle and return `false`.
4.  If the sum becomes 1, we've found a happy number and return `true`.

The use of a `HashSet` is crucial for efficient cycle detection.  Instead of repeatedly iterating or calculating to see if a number leads to 1 or a cycle, the `HashSet` offers O(1) lookup time.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structure:** `HashSet` - Used to store the numbers encountered during the process. The `HashSet` allows for efficient O(1) average case lookup to detect cycles.
*   **Algorithm:**  Iteration and Cycle Detection - We iteratively calculate the sum of squares of digits.  Cycle detection is achieved using the `HashSet`.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isHappy(int n) {
        HashSet<Long> val = new HashSet<>();
        long sum = n;
        while (sum != 1)
        {
            if (val.contains(sum))
                return false;
            val.add(sum);
            long temp = sum;
            sum = 0;
            while (temp > 0)
            {
                long d = temp % 10;
                sum += d * d;
                temp /= 10;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

*   **`class Solution { ... }`:** Defines the class `Solution` which contains the `isHappy` method.
*   **`public boolean isHappy(int n)`:** This is the main method that takes an integer `n` as input and returns `true` if it is a happy number and `false` otherwise.
*   **`HashSet<Long> val = new HashSet<>();`:**  Initializes a `HashSet` called `val` to store the numbers seen during the process.  Using `Long` handles potential overflow issues during the sum of squares calculation.
*   **`long sum = n;`:**  Initializes `sum` with the input number `n`. `sum` will hold the sum of squares of digits in each iteration.
*   **`while (sum != 1)`:**  This is the main loop that continues as long as the `sum` is not equal to 1.
*   **`if (val.contains(sum))`**  Checks if the current `sum` is already present in the `val` `HashSet`. If it is, it means we've encountered this number before, indicating a cycle, so we return `false`.
*   **`val.add(sum);`:** Adds the current `sum` to the `val` `HashSet` so that we can detect it later if we encounter it again.
*   **`long temp = sum;`:** Creates a temporary variable `temp` to hold the current `sum`. This is done because we'll be modifying `temp` in the inner loop while keeping the original `sum` for the cycle detection.
*   **`sum = 0;`:** Resets `sum` to 0. This variable will be used to calculate the sum of squares of the digits of `temp`.
*   **`while (temp > 0)`:** This inner loop iterates through the digits of `temp`.
*   **`long d = temp % 10;`:** Extracts the last digit of `temp` using the modulo operator (`%`).
*   **`sum += d * d;`:** Adds the square of the extracted digit `d` to `sum`.
*   **`temp /= 10;`:** Removes the last digit from `temp` by integer division.
*   **`return true;`:** If the `while` loop finishes and `sum` is equal to 1, it means the number is a happy number, so we return `true`.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:**  O(log * n) in the average case, where n is the input number. The outer `while` loop iterates until `sum` becomes 1 or a cycle is detected. The number of iterations of the outer loop depends on how quickly the number approaches 1 or enters a cycle. The inner `while` loop iterates through the digits of `temp`, which takes O(log n) time where n is the value of `temp`. While the worst case time complexity is hard to define, in practice the code is relatively efficient.

*   **Space Complexity:** O(log n). The space complexity is dominated by the `HashSet`, which stores the numbers encountered during the process. In the worst case, the `HashSet` might store a number of unique numbers related to the digits of the original number. The maximum number of unique numbers that can be present within the HashSet would also depend on the number of digits within the number itself. Therefore it can be seen as O(log n) where n is the size of the input.
