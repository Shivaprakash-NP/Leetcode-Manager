## Maximum Manhattan Distance After K Changes: A Detailed Explanation

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to find the maximum Manhattan distance achievable after making at most `k` changes to the directions (N, S, E, W) in a given string `s`.  A change involves swapping a direction with its opposite (N <-> S, E <-> W). The Manhattan distance is calculated as `|North - South| + |East - West|`.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution cleverly utilizes a brute-force approach combined with a key observation.  Instead of exploring all possible combinations of changes (which would be computationally expensive), it focuses on only four key combinations:

* Changing 'N' and 'E' to their opposites ('S' and 'W')
* Changing 'N' and 'W' to their opposites ('S' and 'E')
* Changing 'S' and 'E' to their opposites ('N' and 'W')
* Changing 'S' and 'W' to their opposites ('N' and 'E')


This is efficient because these combinations cover all possibilities of maximizing the Manhattan distance by strategically changing pairs of directions.  For each combination, the `sol` function iterates through the string, making changes only when it's beneficial (increases the Manhattan distance) and the change budget `k` is available. The function keeps track of the running Manhattan distance and updates the maximum seen so far. The main `maxDistance` function calls `sol` for each of the four crucial combinations and returns the global maximum.


**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**  The primary data structure used is a `String` to represent the directions.  Internally, it's treated as an array of characters using `toCharArray()`.
* **Algorithms:** The core algorithm is a brute-force approach optimized through careful selection of the search space.  This involves iteration and simple arithmetic operations to calculate the Manhattan distance.

**4. Code Walkthrough:**

* **`sol(char a, char b, int k, String s)`:** This function takes two characters (`a` and `b`), representing the pair of directions to potentially change, the number of allowed changes `k`, and the direction string `s`.
    * It initializes counters for North (`n`), South (`S`), East (`e`), and West (`w`).
    * It iterates through each character (`c`) in `s`.
    * **Conditional Logic:** If `c` is equal to `a` or `b` (or if `k` is 0, meaning no more changes are allowed), it increments the corresponding counter.  Otherwise, it makes a change (increments the opposite counter) and decrements `k`.
    * **Manhattan Distance Calculation:** After each character, it updates `dis` (the maximum Manhattan distance seen so far) by calculating `Math.abs(n-S) + Math.abs(e-w)`.
    * **Return Value:** It returns the maximum Manhattan distance found.


* **`maxDistance(String s, int k)`:** This function serves as the main entry point.
    * It initializes `ans` to 0.
    * It calls `sol` four times, once for each of the four key combinations of directions mentioned earlier.  Each call updates `ans` to the maximum distance seen so far.
    * **Return Value:** It returns the final maximum Manhattan distance `ans`.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(4 * n), where n is the length of the input string `s`. The `sol` function iterates through the string once for each of the four calls in `maxDistance`. Therefore, the overall time complexity is linear with respect to the string length.

* **Space Complexity:** O(1). The space used is constant, as the algorithm uses only a fixed number of variables to store counters and the maximum distance, regardless of the input string's length.  The space used by `toCharArray()` is also considered constant because it is proportional to the input string size and can be reasonably disregarded in the Big O analysis.

**In summary:** The solution cleverly reduces the search space for finding the maximum Manhattan distance by focusing on four key change combinations. This leads to a highly efficient linear time and constant space solution, making it a robust and optimized approach for this problem.
