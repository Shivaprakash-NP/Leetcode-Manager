## Statistics from a Large Sample

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem provides a frequency count of numbers in a large sample. The `count` array represents how many times each number from 0 to 255 appears in the sample. The task is to calculate and return the following statistics of the sample: minimum value, maximum value, mean, median, and mode.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is to efficiently calculate the required statistics directly from the frequency count array without explicitly reconstructing the entire sample data.

*   **Minimum and Maximum:** Iterate through the `count` array from the beginning to find the first non-zero element, which represents the minimum value. Similarly, iterate from the end to find the last non-zero element, representing the maximum value.
*   **Mean:**  Calculate the sum of all the values (value * frequency) and divide it by the total number of elements.
*   **Mode:** Iterate through the `count` array and keep track of the element with the highest frequency.
*   **Median:**  Since the sample is sorted based on the `count` array indices, we can find the median by finding the middle element(s). If the total count is odd, the median is the element at the middle index. If the total count is even, the median is the average of the two elements at the middle indices. A helper function `median()` is created to assist in finding the median value(s) in the `count` array.

This approach is chosen because it avoids storing the large sample in memory, making it efficient in terms of space. The statistics are computed directly from the frequency distribution, which takes advantage of the problem's specific data structure.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:**  The main data structure used is the `int[] count` array, which serves as a frequency table. No other complex data structures are needed.
*   **Algorithms:**
    *   **Iteration:** The code extensively uses iteration to traverse the `count` array for finding min, max, mean, mode and median.
    *   **Linear Search (Implicit):** The search for the minimum and maximum values, as well as for the k-th smallest element for median calculation, is a linear search.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

**`sampleStats(int[] count)` Function:**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   `n`: Total number of elements in the sample (initialized to 0).
    *   `sum`: Sum of all values in the sample (initialized to 0).
    *   `min`: Minimum value (initialized to `Double.MAX_VALUE` to ensure any value in `count` will be less).
    *   `max`: Maximum value (initialized to 0).
    *   `mean`: Mean of the sample (initialized to 0).
    *   `mode`: Mode of the sample (initialized to 0).
    *   `med`: Median of the sample (initialized to 0).
    *   `maxCount`: Maximum frequency encountered so far (initialized to 0).

2.  **Iteration and Calculation:**
    *   The code iterates through the `count` array using a `for` loop.
    *   `if (count[i] != 0)`:  This condition checks if the current value `i` is present in the sample (i.e., its frequency is not zero).
    *   `n += count[i]`:  Adds the frequency `count[i]` to the total count `n`.
    *   `min = Math.min(min, i)`:  Updates the minimum value if `i` is smaller than the current `min`.
    *   `max = Math.max(max, i)`:  Updates the maximum value if `i` is larger than the current `max`.
    *   `sum += (long) i * count[i]`:  Adds the contribution of value `i` to the total sum.  The `(long)` cast prevents potential integer overflow since `i * count[i]` could exceed the maximum value of an `int`.
    *   `if (count[i] > maxCount)`:  Checks if the current frequency `count[i]` is greater than the current maximum frequency `maxCount`.
    *   `maxCount = count[i]` and `mode = i`: If the current frequency is higher, update `maxCount` and set the current value `i` as the new mode.

3.  **Mean and Median Calculation:**
    *   `mean = (double) sum / (double) n`: Calculates the mean by dividing the total sum by the total count.  The `(double)` casts ensure floating-point division.
    *   **Median:** Calculates the median based on whether the total count `n` is odd or even.
        *   `if (n % 2 == 1)`: If `n` is odd, the median is the middle element, which is found using the `median` helper function with parameters `count`, `n / 2 + 1`, and `-1`.
        *   `else`: If `n` is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements. The `median` helper function is called twice, once for the first middle element (`n / 2`) and once for the second middle element (`n / 2 + 1`).
4.  **Return:**
    *   `return new double[]{min, max, mean, med, mode}`: Returns an array containing the calculated statistics.

**`median(int[] count, int k, int s)` Function:**

This function helps to find the k-th smallest element(s) which is used to calculate the median.

1.  **`if (s == -1)` block (Odd number of elements):**
    *   The purpose of this block is to find the k-th smallest element.
    *   It iterates through the `count` array, accumulating the counts in the variable `c`.
    *   `if (c >= k)`: If the accumulated count `c` becomes greater than or equal to `k`, it means the k-th smallest element is found at index `i`.  The function returns `(double) i`, the value of this element.

2.  **`else` block (Even number of elements):**
    *   The purpose of this block is to find the two middle elements and average them to calculate the median.
    *   It iterates through the `count` array, accumulating the counts in the variable `c`.
    *   `if (!foundA && c >= k)`: This condition finds the first middle element.  `foundA` is a boolean flag to ensure we only find the *first* middle element once. If the accumulated count `c` becomes greater than or equal to `k`, it means the first middle element is found at index `i`.  The function assigns `i` to `a` and sets `foundA = true`.
    *   `if (c >= s)`:  This condition finds the second middle element. When the accumulated count `c` is greater than or equal to `s`, it means the second middle element is found at index `i`.  The function assigns `i` to `b` and breaks the loop.
    *   `return (a + b) / 2.0`: Returns the average of the two middle elements, `a` and `b`.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the length of the `count` array (256 in this case).  Both `sampleStats` and `median` functions iterate through the `count` array at most once or twice.  Since N is fixed to 256, the time complexity can also be considered O(1).

*   **Space Complexity:** O(1).  The code uses a fixed number of variables regardless of the size of the input sample. The extra space used by the `count` array is part of the problem input and not considered here.
