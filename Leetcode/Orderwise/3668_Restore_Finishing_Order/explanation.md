## Restore Finishing Order Problem Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem is about restoring a finishing order from a mixed list. We are given two arrays: `order` and `friends`. The `order` array represents a potentially mixed-up order of finishers. The `friends` array contains the IDs of the finishers who are known to be friends. Our task is to reconstruct a new array that contains only the friends' finishing order, maintaining their original relative order as they appear in the `order` array.  Essentially, we filter the `order` array, keeping only elements that are also present in the `friends` array, and preserving their initial order.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The core idea is to iterate through the `order` array and check if each element is present in the `friends` array. If an element is in `friends`, it means it's a friend and should be added to the resulting array. The order is preserved because we traverse the `order` array linearly and append elements to the `ans` array as we encounter them.

The use of a `HashSet` to store the `friends` allows for efficient `O(1)` average-case time complexity lookups. This makes the overall solution faster compared to iterating through the `friends` array for each element in the `order` array.

The chosen approach is straightforward and effective because it directly addresses the problem's requirements: filtering elements based on presence in another array and preserving order.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structure:** `HashSet`: Used to store the `friends` array for efficient membership checking. `HashSet` provides, on average, O(1) time complexity for `contains()` operation.
*   **Algorithm:** Linear Traversal/Filtering: The core algorithm involves iterating through the `order` array and selectively adding elements to the `ans` array based on their presence in the `friends` set.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] recoverOrder(int[] order, int[] friends) {
        int n = friends.length; // Get the length of the friends array. This is not used directly in determining the result array size, so it's actually determining how many friends there are. The output array will have the size of *friends* in the *order* array.
        int[] ans = new int[n]; // Create the array to store the result. Allocate space for *n* elements. This assumes all friends finished. However, a test case could be designed where some friends didn't finish the race.
        int ind = 0; // Initialize the index for the ans array.

        // Create a HashSet to store the friends for efficient lookup
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int f : friends) {
            set.add(f); // Add each friend to the set.
        }

        // Iterate through the order array and check if the current element is a friend.
        for(int i = 0; i<order.length; i++) {
            if(set.contains(order[i])) ans[ind++] = order[i]; // If order[i] is present in the friend set, add it to the ans array and increment the index.
        }
        return ans; // Return the restored finishing order array.
    }
}
```

*   **`int n = friends.length;`**: Stores the number of friends. While technically this variable could be smaller than `ans`'s actual size at the end, LeetCode's test cases allow this and the returned `ans` array can have trailing 0's.
*   **`int[] ans = new int[n];`**: Creates a new integer array called `ans` to store the restored finishing order. The size of `ans` is initialized to the length of the `friends` array. It assumes that all friends finished the race.
*   **`int ind = 0;`**: Initializes an index `ind` to 0. This index will be used to keep track of the current position to insert elements into the `ans` array.
*   **`Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();`**: Creates a new `HashSet` called `set`. This set will store the IDs of the friends for efficient lookup.
*   **`for (int f : friends) { set.add(f); }`**: Iterates through the `friends` array and adds each friend's ID to the `set`. This allows for checking if an ID is a friend in O(1) average time complexity.
*   **`for(int i = 0; i<order.length; i++) { if(set.contains(order[i])) ans[ind++] = order[i]; }`**: This is the core logic. It iterates through the `order` array. For each element `order[i]`, it checks if it's present in the `set` (i.e., if it's a friend). If it is, then the element `order[i]` is added to the `ans` array at the index `ind`, and `ind` is incremented.
*   **`return ans;`**: Returns the `ans` array, which contains the restored finishing order of the friends.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(m + k), where `m` is the length of the `friends` array and `k` is the length of the `order` array.

    *   O(m) to add all friends to the `HashSet`.
    *   O(k) to iterate through the `order` array and check if each element is in the `HashSet`.

*   **Space Complexity:** O(m), where `m` is the length of the `friends` array. This is due to the space used by the `HashSet` to store the friends' IDs. The space taken by the `ans` array is not considered in this complexity analysis, because, according to common LeetCode complexity calculation rules, the result/output array's space is excluded. If the size of the resulting array had depended on the input, such as if you were asked to copy a sorted list from one list to another without duplicates, it would then have been included in the space complexity, since the output is intrinsically linked to the input and a unique output has to be generated. If you're simply modifying the input array in-place, then this is often not included as well.
