Okay, here's a detailed explanation of the Java code for the LeetCode problem "Move Zeroes", formatted in Markdown.

## Move Zeroes

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to rearrange the elements of an integer array such that all the zeros are moved to the end of the array, while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements. This must be done *in-place* (i.e., without creating a new array).

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The key idea behind this solution is to iterate through the array and maintain a pointer (`ind`) that tracks the position where the next non-zero element should be placed. When we encounter a non-zero element, we move it to the position pointed to by `ind` and increment `ind`.  Effectively, we're filling the beginning of the array with non-zero elements in their original order. After the loop, all the positions after `ind` will contain the original zeroes, since only non-zero numbers were swapped to the front. By assigning zero to the original index `i` after the swap, we ensure that the algorithm will indeed move the zeroes to the end.

This approach is chosen because it fulfills the in-place requirement and provides a simple, efficient solution.  It avoids unnecessary operations or the use of extra space.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:** The primary data structure is the input `int[] nums`, which is modified in-place.  No additional data structures are used.
*   **Algorithms:** The algorithm uses a single `for` loop for iterating through the array. Within the loop, a conditional statement (`if`) checks for non-zero elements, and a simple swapping logic is used to move the elements. This can be classified as a modified in-place array manipulation algorithm.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public void moveZeroes(int[] nums) {
        int ind = 0; // Initialize the pointer 'ind' to 0. This pointer will track the index where the next non-zero element should be placed.

        for(int i = 0 ; i<nums.length ; i++) // Iterate through the entire array 'nums'.
        {
            if(nums[i]!=0) // Check if the current element 'nums[i]' is non-zero.
            {
                int tem = nums[i]; // Store the value of the non-zero element in a temporary variable 'tem'.
                nums[i] = 0; // replace current non-zero index with zero
                nums[ind++] = tem; // Move the non-zero element to the position pointed to by 'ind', then increment 'ind'.
            }
        }
    }
}
```

*   **`int ind = 0;`**:  Initializes an integer variable `ind` to 0. This variable acts as a pointer, keeping track of the next available position for a non-zero element.

*   **`for(int i = 0 ; i<nums.length ; i++)`**: This loop iterates through each element of the input array `nums`, using the index `i`.

*   **`if(nums[i]!=0)`**: Inside the loop, this `if` statement checks if the current element `nums[i]` is not equal to zero.

*   **`int tem = nums[i];`**: If `nums[i]` is non-zero, its value is stored in a temporary variable `tem`. This is done to facilitate the swapping operation.

*   **`nums[i] = 0;`**: After storing non-zero number, replace it with 0.

*   **`nums[ind++] = tem;`**:  The non-zero element is then placed at the `ind` index in the `nums` array. The post-increment operator `ind++` ensures that `ind` is incremented *after* the value of `ind` is used to assign the non-zero value.  This effectively moves the non-zero element to its correct position and prepares the next position for another non-zero element.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** The code iterates through the array `nums` once using a single `for` loop. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the array.
*   **Space Complexity:** The algorithm modifies the input array in-place and uses only a constant amount of extra space (for the `ind` and `tem` variables). Therefore, the space complexity is O(1).
