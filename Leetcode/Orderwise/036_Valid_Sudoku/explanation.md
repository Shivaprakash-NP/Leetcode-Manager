## LeetCode: Valid Sudoku - Solution Explained

**1. Problem Understanding:**

The problem asks us to determine if a given 9x9 Sudoku board is valid. A valid Sudoku board follows these rules:

* Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
* Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
* Each of the nine 3x3 subgrids must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.  A '.' character represents an empty cell.

**2. Approach / Intuition:**

The solution employs a straightforward approach using sets to check for duplicates within rows, columns, and 3x3 subgrids.  Sets are chosen because they provide efficient constant-time (O(1)) average-case complexity for `contains()` and `add()` operations. This approach directly addresses the problem constraints by iterating through each row, column, and subgrid and verifying the uniqueness of the numbers present.  This is a brute-force approach, but it's efficient enough for the given constraints (9x9 grid).  More optimized approaches would be unnecessarily complex for this problem.

**3. Data Structures and Algorithms:**

* **Data Structures:**  `HashSet<Character>` is used to store the digits encountered in each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid.  Hash sets are ideal because they provide efficient membership testing (checking if a digit already exists).
* **Algorithms:** The core algorithm is a nested loop iteration. We iterate through rows, columns, and 3x3 subgrids to check for duplicates within each.

**4. Code Walkthrough:**

The code is divided into three main parts:

* **Row and Column Check:**
  ```java
  for(int i = 0; i<9; i++) {
      Set<Character> set1 = new HashSet<>();
      Set<Character> set2 = new HashSet<>();
      for(int j = 0; j<9; j++) {
          if(board[i][j] != '.') {
              if(set1.contains(board[i][j])) return false;
              set1.add(board[i][j]);
          }
          if(board[j][i] != '.') {
              if(set2.contains(board[j][i])) return false;
              set2.add(board[j][i]);
          }
      }
  }
  ```
  This part iterates through each row (`i`) and column (`j`). For each row, `set1` tracks the digits encountered. If a duplicate is found (`set1.contains(board[i][j])`), the function immediately returns `false`.  The same logic applies to columns using `set2`.


* **3x3 Subgrid Check:**
  ```java
  for(int i = 0; i<3; i++) {
      for(int j = 0; j<3; j++) {
          Set<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
          for(int k = 0; k<3; k++) {
              for(int l = 0; l<3; l++) {
                  if(board[i*3+k][j*3+l] == '.') continue;
                  if(set.contains(board[i*3+k][j*3+l])) return false;
                  set.add(board[i*3+k][j*3+l]);
              }
          }
      }
  }
  ```
  This section iterates through each of the nine 3x3 subgrids. The outer loops (`i` and `j`) determine the starting coordinates of each subgrid. The inner loops (`k` and `l`) iterate through the cells within the subgrid.  Similar to the row/column check, it uses a `HashSet` (`set`) to detect duplicates.


* **Return Value:**
  ```java
  return true;
  ```
  If all checks pass without finding any duplicates, the function returns `true`, indicating a valid Sudoku board.


**5. Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of cells in the Sudoku board (81).  We iterate through each cell a constant number of times (once for rows, once for columns, and once for subgrids).  The set operations (`contains` and `add`) are on average O(1).

* **Space Complexity:** O(n) as well. The space is dominated by the `HashSet` objects.  In the worst-case scenario (a board with no empty cells and no duplicates), we'll create a maximum of 27 sets (9 rows + 9 columns + 9 subgrids), each storing up to 9 digits.  This amounts to O(n) space complexity.


In summary, this solution provides a clear, concise, and efficient way to solve the Valid Sudoku problem by leveraging the properties of HashSets. The time and space complexity are both linear with respect to the number of cells in the Sudoku board.
