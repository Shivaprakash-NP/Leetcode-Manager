## Count Total Number of Colored Cells - Explanation

### 1. Problem Understanding:

The problem asks us to calculate the total number of colored cells in a grid after `n` steps of a specific pattern growth. In the first step (n=1), there is 1 colored cell (a single cell). In the second step (n=2), the single colored cell from the previous step expands by adding a layer of colored cells to all four sides, resulting in 5 colored cells. In the third step (n=3), another layer expands the colored area, and so on. We need to derive a formula to directly calculate the number of colored cells for a given `n`.

### 2. Approach / Intuition:

The problem is essentially asking us to identify a mathematical pattern or formula that describes how the number of colored cells grows with each step.

*   **Pattern Recognition:** We can analyze the first few steps to find a pattern:
    *   n = 1: 1 cell
    *   n = 2: 5 cells
    *   n = 3: 13 cells
    *   n = 4: 25 cells

*   **Formula Derivation:**  Notice that the differences between consecutive terms are: 4, 8, 12,... This suggests a quadratic relationship. Let's examine the formula `2n^2 - 2n + 1`:
    *   n = 1: 2(1)^2 - 2(1) + 1 = 1
    *   n = 2: 2(2)^2 - 2(2) + 1 = 5
    *   n = 3: 2(3)^2 - 2(3) + 1 = 13
    *   n = 4: 2(4)^2 - 2(4) + 1 = 25
This appears to be the correct formula.  It can also be expressed as  `1 + 2 * n * (n - 1)`.

*   **Why this approach?**  This direct formula approach is efficient and avoids iterative calculations. Once the pattern is recognized and verified, we can directly compute the result, resulting in a much faster solution than a simulation-based approach.

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms:

*   **Data Structures:** No complex data structures are used. We primarily deal with integer variables.
*   **Algorithms:** No advanced algorithms are employed. The solution relies on simple arithmetic operations and a derived formula.

### 4. Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public long coloredCells(int n) {
        return (1+((long)n * (long)(n-1) * (long) 2));
    }
}
```

*   `class Solution { ... }`:  Defines a class named `Solution`, which is standard practice in LeetCode.
*   `public long coloredCells(int n) { ... }`: Declares a public method called `coloredCells` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a `long` (a 64-bit integer).  We use `long` because `n * (n - 1) * 2` can potentially exceed the maximum value of an `int`, especially for larger values of `n`.
*   `return (1+((long)n * (long)(n-1) * (long) 2));`: This is the core of the solution.
    *   `(long) n`: Explicitly casts the integer `n` to a `long` to avoid potential integer overflow during the multiplication.
    *   `(long) (n - 1)`: Casts the result of `n - 1` to a `long` as well for the same reason.
    *   `(long) 2`: Casts 2 to a long.
    *   The expression then calculates `n * (n - 1) * 2`, which represents `2n^2 - 2n`
    *   Finally, `1 + (2 * n * (n - 1))` calculates `2n^2 - 2n + 1`, giving the total number of colored cells.  The result is returned as a `long`.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity:

*   **Time Complexity:** O(1) - The solution involves only a few arithmetic operations, regardless of the input value `n`.  Therefore, the time complexity is constant.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1) - The solution uses a fixed amount of memory (for variables like `n` and the return value), regardless of the input size.  Therefore, the space complexity is constant.
