# 💻 Leetcode-Manager

This repository is a **comprehensive collection of LeetCode solutions in Java**, complete with:

- ✅ Problem statements  
- 🧠 Detailed explanations  
- 💡 Clean and readable Java code  

Solutions are neatly organized in **two formats**:
- 📂 `Topicwise/` — categorized by data structures and algorithms (like `Binary Tree`, `DP`, `Hash Table`, etc.)
- 📂 `Orderwise/` — organized according to official LeetCode problem numbers and order (e.g., `001_Two_Sum`, `287_Find_the_Duplicate_Number`, etc.)

## 📌 About

This project aims to serve as:
- A **structured learning guide** for mastering DSA through Java
- A **reference library** of solved problems with clean code
- A **resource for interview prep**

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔢 **Hundreds of problems** covered (and counting!)
- 🧠 **Explanations included** to aid understanding
- 🧰 **Organized into Topicwise and Orderwise** formats

## ⚙️ Auto-Generated

All files in this repository are **auto-generated** using a custom script available in a separate repo:

📂 **Script Repo:** [Leetcode-Manager-script](https://github.com/Shivaprakash-NP/Leetcode-Manager-Script)
This script:
- Fetches your accepted solutions from LeetCode
- Extracts and formats problem statements and explanations
- Organizes them into clean folders and files

> 🛠 If you're curious to learn how the automation works or want to build your own, check out the script repo above.

## 🏁 How to Use

If you're preparing for interviews, learning DSA, or reviewing problems:

- Browse `Topicwise/` to master individual topics (e.g., `Graph`, `DP`, `Backtracking`)
- Browse `Orderwise/` if you're solving LeetCode sequentially
- Copy, learn, and modify the code as you practice
